African Clawed Frogs	suitable for beginners.	up to 15 years, perhaps longer.	strictly aquatic.	\N	These frogs are in the same family but different genus than the dwarf African frog, Hymenochirus boettgeri which has become very popular in recent years. However, the care of dwarf frogs is similar (on a smaller scale).	\N	4-5 inches (10-13 cm).	A gravel substrate can be used, but small gravel should be avoided to prevent accidental ingestion of the substrate. Rocks, wood, and flower pots can be used to decorate the tank and provide hiding places (frogs with no place to hide may be stressed). Artificial plants can also be used, but the frogs will dig up and generally destroy live plants.	\N	\N	\N	The tank can be kept at room temperature - 68-75 F (20-24 C). No special lighting is required (indirect lighting is fine and may be preferred). A 12 hour light:12 hour dark light cycle can be used.	The issue of filtration is somewhat controversial. The frogs have a sensory system (lateral line) that allows them to sense vibrations in the water, so some experts believe that using filters provides constant stressful stimuli to the frog (compared to a human constantly being exposed to the noise from a jackhammer). However, gentle filtration is used by some owners with success, and this will keep the water a lot cleaner. These frogs live in stagnant water in the wild, but that is not the same as dirty water in an aquarium. If no filtration is used, the water should be nearly fully changed every week, if not more often.

African Fat Tailed Geckos	\N	Fat tailed geckos can live for up to 15 years, possible more.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Fat tailed geckos reach a length of 8-10 inches.	Orchid bark, cypress mulch, coconut fiber bedding, or peat moss can be used for a substrate and will help maintain humidity. Hides, logs, cork bark pieces, rocks, and plants should be provided for fat tailed geckos.	\N	A 10 gallon tank is probably sufficient for a single fat tailed gecko, but larger is better. Hides, logs, cork bark pieces, rocks, and plants can be provided.	\N	The daytime temperature gradient should be around 80-90 F (27-32 C) but can drop to 75-80 F (24-27 C) at night. Undertank heating is preferred, although a heat lamp (a nocturnal bulb works well) can be used as well if needed. No UV lighting is necessary.	\N

African Spurred Tortoise	\N	Sulcata tortoises can live 80-100 years, perhaps longer.	\N	\N	Do not hibernate. Also, make sure there is nothing that the tortoise can climb on (steep surfaces, steps, etc.) and tip over onto its back. If they end up on their back when you are not around to rescue them, it is possible they will die.	\N	Sulcata tortoise are very large, reaching an adult length of 24-30 inches and weighing in at 80-110 pounds.	\N	Supplementation with calcium/Vitamin D3 is recommended.	\N	\N	\N	\N

American Green Tree Frogs	\N	\N	\N	American green tree frogs are strictly nocturnal, so no supplemental UVA/UVB light is strictly required. Some people believe some supplemental fluorescent UV light is beneficial, as long as it is neither too bright or used more than a few hours a day.	Green with a light stripe from the side of the head down flanks. Quite readily available in the pet trade. At about 1.5 to 2.5 inches (4-6 cm) fully grown, the American tree frog can be kept in a fairly small cage.Although susceptible to stress (especially from shipping), they are fairly hardy if a healthy frog is found. Suitable for beginning pet frog owners.	\N	\N	can use a variety of materials, such as gravel (should be smooth), cypress mulch, or soil with peat/vermiculite (just be sure the frog is not ingesting substrate while feeding). Some people use indoor/outdoor carpeting.  The substrate can largely be covered with moss and cork bark.	\N	\N	\N	From 68-77F (20-25C) with a night time drop of a few degrees is sufficient for summer, and a slightly cooler temperature gradient can be provided in the winter months. A combination of under tank heating and/or a low wattage basking light or heat element (placed outside of the tank to prevent burns if the frog tried to jump on the light) works well. Make sure the appropriate temperature gradient is provided by measuring temperatures in various spots around the tank.	provide a large shallow sturdy water dish with dechlorinated water (must be shallow since these frogs are not good swimmers). The cage should also be misted with dechlorinated water daily to maintain humidity.More tips on setting up an arboreal cage can be found on the Frogland site (http://allaboutfrogs.org/info/housing/arbtank.html).
Anoles	\N	\N	\N	in addition to the incandescent basking light, provide a full spectrum UVA/UVB light for 10-12 hours per day.	\"The General Care and Maintenance of Green Anoles\" by Phillipe De Vosjoli	\N	\N	A substrate of peat moss and soil with or without a layer of bark (e.g. orchid bark) is an ideal substrate for anoles.	\N	\N	\N	during the day, provide a gradient from 75-80 F (24-27 C) with a basking spot of 85-90 F (29-32 C). A combination of under tank heating and a basking light on one side of the tank works well. Make sure the appropriate temperature gradient is provided by measuring temperatures in various spots around the tank. Night temperature can drop to a gradient of 65-75 F (18-24 C).  Do not use basking lights to achieve night time temperatures - use heating pads and/or ceramic heating elements.	\N
Axolotls	\N	\N	\N	No special lighting is required, and in fact a place to get out of the light may be appreciated, such as a half flowerpot or aquarium type castle.	For more detailed information on Axolotls, there are several good resources on the Web.Axolotls (http://www.axolotl.org/), Christen\'s Axolotl Homepage (http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/4301/calixto.htm) The Short Guide to Axolotl Husbandry (by Susan T. Du hon) (http://www.ambystoma.org/AGSC/guide.htm)	\N	\N	If gravel is used on the bottom of the tank it needs to be coarse gravel. Fine gravel might be ingested during feeding. Some keepers simply leave the bottom of the tank bare, although others believe this may stress the axolotls a bit since they can\'t get a foothold on the bottom that way.	\N	Axolotls can get quite large, so I would recommend at least a 15-20 gallon tank, although the tank doesn\'t have to be full - just deeper than the full length of the axolotl. Most owners will find a filtered aquarium easier to maintain; without a filter their water will need frequent changing. However, the filtration rate should be fairly slow and avoid powerful filters that create strong currents. The filter intake should not be in a position to trap the gills. A siphon can be used to vacuum the bottom of the tank, and a 20 percent water change should be done weekly. If you are not using a filter, you will have to do a 20\\% water change every day or every other day. Never do a full water change as this creates a situation where the water chemistry changes too drastically.	\N	The tank should be kept in a cool room away from bright sunlight. The water temperature should be kept cool,between 57-68 F (14-20 C), and never above 75 F (24 C).	should not have any chlorine or chloramines (added during the water treatment process) removed using commercially available solutions. Never use distilled water. The pH of the water should be 6.5-7.5.
Ball Pythons	\N	20-30 years average, with proper care up to about 50 years	\N	\N	If you already have a constricting snake at home, any new python (or boa) should be quarantined due to the risk of inclusion body disease. Experts vary on the length of quarantine, but 3-6 months is not extreme. In addition, a vet check is in order, especially for internal (take a recent stool sample) and external parasites.	\N	Young ball pythons grow about a foot a year for three years.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Bearded Dragons	\N	10 years	\N	\N	\N	\N	18-24 inches (reached by about 2 years of age),	\N	\N	a good sized tank/cage will be required.	\N	\N	\N
Blue Tongued Skinks	\N	\N	\N	in addition to the incandescent basking light, provide a full spectrum UVA/UVB light for 10-12 hours per day.	\N	\N	\N	aspen wood shavings, cypress mulch, or even newspaper. Make sure they are not ingesting wood substrates.	\N	\N	\N	gradient from 75-85 F (24-29 C) with a basking spot of 95 F (35 C).  A combination of undertank heating and a basking light on one side of the tank works well. Make sure the appropriate temperature gradient is provided by measuring temperatures in various spots around the tank. Night temperature can drop to about 70 F (21 C).	provide a large shallow sturdy water dish. Skinks like to bathe in their water but often defecate there so frequent cleaning is required for the water dish.
Boa Constrictor	\N	25-20 years	\N	\N	When choosing a boa constrictor, look for the following signs of a healthy snake; alert firm, muscular body, no loose fold of skin, tongue fliking, eyes clear, no signs of retained shed (check eyes, end of tail), no visible external parasites, clean vent, scales healthy, no brown or curled edges, no wounds on skin, reacts to handling by coiling firmly (but gently) on hand/arm, and relaxing a bit after a while.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

Chinese Water Dragon	\N	\N	\N	\N	For a very thorough discussion of water dragon care, see Tricia\'s Water Dragon Care Page (http://www.triciaswaterdragon.com/dragoncr.htm)	\N	\N	\N	Use a calcium/vitamin D3 supplement on the food at every other feeding, and a complete vitamin/mineral supplement once a week.	\N	\N	\N	\N
Corn Snake	\N	around 15-20 years, sometimes longer.	\N	\N	Choosing a snake: A captive bred specimen is the best choice and shouldn\'t be too difficult to find since corn snakes breed fairly readily in captivity. Look for a snake that is well fleshed with clear eyes, no cuts or scrapes, no signs of mites or ticks, a clean vent, and one that is alert and flicking its tongue.	\N	corn snakes reach a mature size of 3-5 feet (occasionally up to 6 feet)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Crested Geckos	\N	Crested Geckos are expected to live 10-20 years or so, though they are relatively new to the reptile hobby so this is a bit uncertain.	\N	Crested geckos are nocturnal so do not need special UV lighting. However, some experts feel providing low levels of UV lighting is still beneficial to their overall health (one must make sure the enclosure does not overheat and that the geckos can hide from the light if desired). A red night time bulb allows viewing when they are most active as well as providing some heat.	Crested geckos were once thought to be extinct, but were \"rediscovered\" around 1994. Since then there popularity as pets has continually increased.Crested geckos usually have fairly docile temperaments, though they can be a bit skittish and care is required when handling as they may try to jump from your grip and be injured. Also, crested geckos may drop their tails if handled roughly or to attempt to get away, but unlike other geckos they will not regenerate their tails.	\N	\N	The substrate for crested geckos should be something that retains moisture to aid in humidity levels, such as coconut fiber bedding, moss, or peat, though paper or paper towels can be used as well. Crested geckos are somewhat prone to ingesting substrate while hunting; if this is the case for yours, use moss (either alone or over another substrate like coconut fiber) or paper towels. Paper towels are recommended for juveniles as they are more likely to accidentally swallow substrate.	\N	\N	\N	A daytime temperature gradient of 72-80 F (22-26.5 C) should be provided for crested geckos, with a drop at night time to 65-75 F (18-24 C).  Crested geckos get stressed at higher temperatures. A low wattage red night-time bulb makes a good heat source. Do not rest a heat source right the top of the tank, as these climbing geckos could get too close and burns could result.	\N
Degu	\N	\N	\N	\N	Never grab or try to pick up a degu by the tail. They can easily lose part of their tail and have a messy injury as a result. Shedding their tail is probably a natural defense of wild degus to escape if caught by the tail.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Make sure you change the water in their bottles regularly - they often do not drink a lot but it is important that they have a supply of fresh clean water available at all times.
Eastern Box Turtle	\N	As with other box turtles, Eastern box turtles can be very long-lived, possibly up to 100 years. Sadly, many in captivity will not survive that long (30-40 years is more typical; even shorter with less than ideal care).	\N	If kept in an outdoor pen, make sure there are both sunny and shady areas available (the turtle should be able to move from cooler to warmer areas as necessary). Indoors, a terrarium will need a neat source as well as a UVB emitting reptile light.	Eastern box turtles can live in a wide variety of habitats from damp forests to dry grassy fields. They will often venture into shallow water. Box turtles hibernate when it gets cold. They are found across the eastern US, from Maine to Northern Florida.	Males tend to have longer, thicker tails than the females. In addition, the plastron is slightly concave in males and flatter in females, while the carapace tends to be more flattened in males (more domed in females). The males tend to have more colorful markings on on the forelegs, and the claws on the hind feed are generally shorter and more curved than those on the females. Males more often have red irises, but not always. It can be difficult to sex box turtles, unless comparing males and females side by side.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Provide a basking spot with temperatures of 85 - 88 F, maintaining the terrarium with a gradient down to about 75 F. The night time temperature should not drop below 70 F.	While box turtles are not aquatic, it is not unusual for them to wade into shallow water to drink and have a soak. Make sure a shallow pan of water is readily accessible (and kept clean) at all times. On hot, dry days, run a sprinkler or mist their pen for added moisture.
Ferret	\N	6-8 years on average (sometimes up to 11 or 12)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Fiddler Crab	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Fiddler crabs do well at a range of temperatures between about 75-85 F (24-29 C).	Because most of these crabs are naturally from brackish waters, most experts recommend putting salt (get aquarium salt from the pet store; never use table salt) in the water. The ideal amount of salt to add is controversial, but it is probably best to get a hydrometer and add enough salt to the water to attain a specific gravity of around 1.005 - 1.010. Hydrometers are not all that expensive and can be found at pet stores and also home brewing shops.  Alternatively, your package of aquarium salt may have instructions for producing brackish water conditions. It is okay to vary the salt concentration/specific gravity slightly as these crabs would naturally experience some variations in salinity.
Fire Bellied Toads	good for beginners	around 10-15 years (sometimes longer)	Semi aquatic	\N	\N	\N	about 2 inches (5 cm)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Flying Squirrel	\N	\N	\N	\N	A good source of information about keeping flying squirrels as well as a place to connect with other owners is the National Flying Squirrel Association (http://www.nfsa.us/) site. Their natural distribution is the Southern and eastern United States.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	should be provided in a shallow open bowl. Southern flying squirrels have been known to have problems with sipper tubes on water bottles.
Gerbils	\N	2-3 years on average (up to 8 reported, though this is exceptional!)	\N	\N	gerbils are social animals, living in colonies in the wild, so do not do well as a solitary pet. Keeping a same sex pair(litter mates usually do well together) is much preferred. However, if you have a single older gerbil, it can be difficult to introduce a new one as they are quite territorial. Some hints on formal introductions can be found in \"How to Introduce Gerbils.\" Generally, frequent handling will keep a gerbil quite tame. If all else fails, bribery with sunflower seeds can help make a gerbil more amenable to handling. For more on handling gerbils see \"Taming and Handling Gerbils.\"	\N	body about 4 inches long, tail another 4 inches.	A fairly thick (2-3 inch) layer of bedding in the cage provides a good base and allows the gerbils to dig a bit. Avoid cedar or pine shavings; aspen is fine to use as are a number of other newer pet-safe beddings available now. See \"The Problem with Wood Shavings\" and \"Top Ten Alternatives to Cedar and Pine Shavings\" for more information.  Nesting material that the gerbils can shred and use to line their nests is also a good idea. The nesting material sold in pet stores is not ideal for this as little feet can get entangled in the strands. It is better to use simple white facial tissue which you can shred into strips for the gerbils, or paper towels and/or grass hay.  Nest Box: Gerbils need a nest box to feel secure; they will hide out in it and use if for sleeping. A sturdy wood or ceramic nest box is preferable to plastic since the plastic will quickly be destroyed by chewing. The wood will likely get chewed to but tends to last a little longer. Clay flower pots are another possible choice.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Giant African Land Snails	\N	\N	\N	\N	Due to the risk of becoming a successful invasive species and becoming a serious agricultural pest, importation of giant african land snails into the US is not permitted, and they are illegal to keep as pets in the US. They are kept as pets in some other countries, however. For more see \"Potential Pet or Potent Pet.\" Giant African land snails are hemraphrodites, meaining they possess both the female and male reproductive organs. Two snails are still needed for breeding, but they are very prolific breeders. A fulica can reprtedly lay 1200 eggs per year. In Africa, giant land snails are used as a food source.	\N	The smaller of these snails (Achatina fulica) grow to be about 3-4 inches long (shell length), while the larger ones (Achatina achatina) can have a shell up to 10-11 inches long (in a snail this size the body stretched out would be about 14-15 inches!).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Giant African Millipedes	\N	about 7-10 years.	\N	no special lighting is required, and should be avoided as the millipedes will spend most of their time hiding to avoid the light.	\N	\N	Adult size is about 10 inches long.	millipedes like to burrow a bit so a good layer (3-4 inches) of peat moss or a peat moss/soil mixture (no chemical or fertilizer added) can form the base. This can be covered with some sphagnum moss and pieces of bark to provide additional cover. Leaf litter can also be used, although you may want to freeze it first to kill insects in it. The substrate should be kept damp (but not wet).	\N	\N	\N	There are varied opinions on the appropriate temperatures for giant millipedes. Since millipedes hail from tropical climates, many keepers recommend that the tank should be kept at about 75-80 F (24-27 C) or even as high as 85 F (30 C). An under tank heater on a thermostat (as sold for reptile keeping) placed under one half of the tank can be used to heat the tank. If placing a heater under the tank warms the substrate too much or dries it out, the heat pad can be affixed to the side or part of the back of the tank. On the other hand, many keepers do not provide supplemental heat. If this is the case, make sure your room temperature during the day is at least 72 F (22 C), although a slight drop at night should be okay.	provide a bit fresh drinking water in a very shallow dish, and clean regularly.
Golden Geckos	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Hamsters	\N	\N	\N	\N	I don\'t advocate the casual owner breeding their hamsters -- that is best left to breeders who concentrate on breeding for health and temperament.  However, there are times when accidents happen, including hamsters that weren\'t separated soon enough at the pet store and come home pregnant. Also, knowing about hamster reproduction can help prevent accidents in the first place. Here\'s help if you find yourself with a pregnant hamster \"Help, My Hamster Had Babies -- What Should I Do?\" (http://exoticpets.about.com/od/hamsters/f/hamsterbabies.htm)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
House Gecko	\N	5-10 years	\N	Golden geckos are nocturnal so do not need special UV lighting. However, many experts feel providing UV lighting is still beneficial to the overall health of nocturnal animals.	Common house geckos are native to much of southern Asia, but have established breeding population in many other warm areas of the world. They are thought to have become such a successful invasive species laregly by hitchhiking on ships and other transport, but owners should be careful not to contribute to the problem by releasing pets.While house geckos live in less inhabited areas as well, they are commonly found around human habitation, including the walls and ceilings of houses, which is how their name arose. They are good at keeping insect populations in check.	\N	\N	The substrate for house geckos should be something that retains moisture, such as reptile bark or shredded coconut fiber bedding.	\N	\N	\N	A daytime temperature  gradient  of 75-90 F (24-32 C) should be provided, with a drop at nightime to 65-75 F (18-24 C).  Heat can be provided a ceramic heat element or reptile bulbs in a reflector, or heat mat under the terrarium.  White incandescent bulbs or blue reptile bulbs can be used, but only during day time hours.  A red night time bulb can be used for heat at night.	\N
Jackson\'s Chameleon	\N	5-10 years in captivity.	\N	Chameleons need an ultraviolet (UVA/UVB) light source, so invest in a good bulb such as the Zoomed Reptisun 5.0. Keep the UV light on for 10-12 hours per day. Remember these bulbs need to be replaced every 6 months. Chameleons also benefit from spending time outdoors in natural sunlight when the temperatures are appropriate (but beware of overheating -- Jackson\'s chameleons do not tolerate temperatures over 90 F (32 C) well.	\N	\N	Jackson\'s chameleons range in size from about 9-13 inches in length (including the tail). Males tend to be larger than females of the same sub species.	Cleanliness in the cage is vital, to prevent bacterial or mold	\N	\N	\N	For Jackson\'s chameleons a daytime temperature gradient of about 70-80 F (21-26.5 C) should be provided, with a basking spot up to a maximum of 85 F (29 C). At night, they should have a temperature drop of about 10-15 F (5-10 C), so heating at night may not be required if your home doesnt fall below 65-70 F (18-21 C). Heating is best accomplished by a basking or incandescent light in a reflector or a ceramic heat element, any of which should be placed outside of the cage to prevent burns.	\N
King Snakes	\N	15-20 years	\N	\N	\N	\N	Up to 6-7 feet in length.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Kinkajous	\N	20-25 years	\N	\N	\N	\N	The size varies somewhat among the subspecies, but in general the body length usually falls somewhere between 16 and 25 inches, tail is another 15-20 inches. Kinkajous usual weigh up to about 8 pounds (some are lighter and it depends a bit on the subspecies).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Leopard Gecko	\N	Leopard geckos may live 20 or more years.	\N	Being nocturnal, leopard geckos require no special UV lighting. A regular incandescent bulb could be used to provide a basking spot, but leopard geckos probably prefer dimmer conditions so consider using a red bulb or ceramic heating element to provide the temperature gradient.	\N	\N	Leopard geckos reach approximately 8-10 inches in length.	Young leopard geckos shouldn\'t be kept on sand, as they may ingest it and suffer an intestinal blockage. Paper is absorbent and easy to change, and indoor outdoor carpet works well too. Avoid wood shavings. Whatever is used, make sure it is not being ingested along with the gecko\'s meals. For more on choosing substrate, the the Leopard Gecko Substrate Debate.	\N	\N	\N	Under tank heaters can be used.  Daytime provide a basking spot of 88 F (31 C) with a gradient to about 75 F (around 24 C). For night you can drop to a gradient of 70-75 F (21- 24 C)	A shallow dish of water should be provided, and cleaned very regularly.
Mexican Redknee Tarantulas	\N	Females, 15-25 years (some sources say up to 30 years). Males, as with other tarantulas, have a much shorter life span.	\N	\N	This is the \"classic\" pet tarantula and has enjoyed tremendous popularity due to its beauty, temperament and long life span.	\N	Mexican redknee tarantulas reach a leg span of about 5 - 5.5 inches.	\N	\N	\N	\N	75-80 F (24-30 C)	\N
Mice	\N	Their short life span is one of the biggest drawbacks of mice. On average they live for about 1.5-2 years, although they can sometimes live up to 3 years.	\N	\N	When picking out your mice, look for active bright mice, with smooth clean coats and pink clean skin on the ears and tail. The eyes and nose should be free of discharge, and the mouth and anal areas should be clean and dry.  Their breathing will be relatively fast, but should not be labored or noisy.  Check the cage as well - it should be clean(the mice have been well cared for) and the droppings should be formed.  Look for a pet store that separates males and females at a young age (good breeders will do this). Mice can reproduce by about 6-8 weeks of age, although this is very stressful on the female and should be avoided. If your pet store doesn\'t separate mice at a young age you may well end up taking home a pregnant female. To tell the difference between young males and females check under their tails for the distance between the anal opening and genital opening- this distance is shorter in the females. A breeder or pet store should be able to do this for you, but it can be hard to do in young mice unless you have males and females to compare to each other. In older (6-8 week old) male mice, the testicles are usually readily visible.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Northern Leopard Frogs	suitable for beginners.	approximately 5-8 years, perhaps longer.	semi aquatic.	no special lighting is required. Some owners use a UVA/UVB fluorescent light which not strictly necessary but is not harmful and may be beneficial.  Just make sure the frog can\'t jump onto the lamp. Avoid making the enclosure too bright however as the frogs may just hide if the tank is very brightly lit. A light cycle of about 10 hours light to 14 hours dark is recommended by some keepers.	\N	\N	approximately 3 inches (7-8 cm).	as mentioned above, a combination of soil and peat moss, covered with a commercial reptile bark substrate and sphagnum moss can be used on the terrestrial side. The depth should be at least 2-3 inches to allow burrowing.  Gravel can be used on the aquatic side. It is extremely important to use smooth gravel only (to prevent skin abrasions and injuries), and ideally the gravel should be large enough not to be swallowed.	\N	\N	\N	the tank can be kept at room temperature - 68-75 F (20-24 C), although a temperature drop at night is a good idea (down to about 60 F or about 16 C).	\N
Ornate Box Turtles	\N	As with other box turtles, Eastern box turtles can be very long-lived, possibly up to 100 years.  Sadly, many in captivity will not survive that long (30-40 years is more typical; even shorter with less than ideal care).	\N	\N	Ornate box turtles are native to the central United States, found from the Gulf Coast states up north to South Dakota and Illinois.  They live in deserts and natural grasslands, often in areas with little water.  Ornate box turtles are not hardy and are not suitable for beginners.  The have very specific needs, are very sensitive to stress and are difficult to keep in captivity.  The wild capture of ornate box turtles for the pet trade has caused the untimely death of many of these easily stressed and delicate turtles, so if you are determined to keep an ornate box turtle please seek out a captive bred specimen and do not support the capture of wild turtles for the pet trade.  Additionally, box turtle populations are declining (listed by CITES as threatened, and import/export permits are necessary).  Many states protect box turtle populations and have laws against collecting box turtles from the wild.  It is best to get a pet box turtle bred in captivity from a reputable breeder.  Wild caught turtles do not adjust well to captivity and many die from the stress. Pet stores often carry wild caught turtles, so be careful.	Sexing ornate box turtles can be quite difficult.  Somtimes the male will have a reddish iris, but this is not always the case.  Unlike the Eastern box turtles, the plastron of both males and females is flat.  The males do tend to have slightly longer and thicker tails than females.	About 6 inches in length.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Ornate box turtles prefer temperatures around 85-88 F during the day, wand 70-75 F at night. Healthy ornate box turtles can be hibernated in the winter.  Make sure their enclosure does not get overheated in warmer months and make sure plenty of shade is available.  A heat lamp in a shelter can provide supplemental heat for cooler days.	\N
Ornate Horned Frogs	\N	\N	\N	a fluorescent fixture can be used, although they might prefer more subdued lighting and regular room light may be enough. A 12 hour light - 12 hour dark cycle can be provided. The use of full spectrum lighting for amphibians is somewhat controversial but probably isn\'t strictly necessary if a balanced diet is provided. The tank should be away from direct sunlight, to prevent overheating.	Pacman frogs are not terribly difficult to care for, so can make a good pet that is quite attractive and interesting. However, people who like their pets active or interactive may get tired of caring for a pacman frog.  Considering a these frogs can live for 7 -10 years, getting one of these frogs amounts to a long term commitment.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The temperature should be kept around 82 F (28 C) during the day, dropping to around 78 F (25 C) at night. Heating is best supplied by an under tank heater as overhead incandescent bulbs can be too drying (although a red incandescent could be used if supplemental heat is needed at colder times).	\N
Panther Chameleons	\N	approximately 5 years in captivity.	\N	Chameleons need an ultraviolet (UVA/UVB) light source, so invest in a good bulb such as the Zoomed Reptisun 5.0. Keep the UV light on for 10-12 hours per day. Remember these bulbs need to be replaced every 6 months. Chameleons also benefit from spending time outdoors in natural sunlight when the temperatures are appropriate (but beware of overheating -- make sure shade is always available).	\N	\N	Panther chameleons can reach up to around 21 inches in length, although those in captivity tend to stay a bit smaller (this includes the tail). Males tend to be larger than females.	Cleanliness in the cage is vital, to prevent bacterial or mold	\N	\N	\N	A daytime temperature gradient of 75-90 F (24-32 C) should be provided, with a basking spot at 95 F (35 C). At night, they should have a temperature drop of about 10-15 F (5-10 C). If your home doesn\'t drop below 65-70 F (18-21 C) at night, heating at night isn\'t necessary. Heating is best accomplished by a basking or incandescent light in a reflector or a ceramic heat element, any of which should be placed outside of the cage to prevent burns.	\N
Praying Mantis	\N	The expected life span of a praying mantis depends on the species, but the maximum is about a year for the entire life cycle.  However, most will only live as adults for about 6 months (less for some species of praying mantis).	\N	\N	As always, check your local laws before deciding on a praying mantis as a pet as they may be illegal where you are.  The term mantid and mantis are often used interchangeably.  Technically, the term mantid is the correct way to refer to all mantids, or members of the (sub)order \"Mantodea.\"  The term Mantis is technically limited to members of the genus \"Mantis\" within this large family.  The term praying mantis may have originally referred to a specific species, ( Mantis religiosa , the European mantis) but now the terms praying mantid (and praying mantis) are used widely to refer to any of the large family of mantids.  The \"praying\" descriptor arose from the way the that mantids hold their grasping front legs, as if in prayer.  Mantids go through simple (incomplete) metamorphosis, so rather than having a larval stage (such as a caterpillar) they start out as very small wingless replicas of the adult (nymphs) that grow and mature in several successive molts.  Mantids are marketed in gardening circles as pest control aids.  DeShawn\'s Mantid Kingdom : great site with several species-specific care sheets.  Mantids  - from Bugs in Cyberspace, just general care information but lots of wonderful photos of various species.	\N	Mantids range from less than an inch up to 6 or more inches in length, depending on the species and sex.  However, the most commonly kept pet species of praying mantis are in the range of 2-3 inches or so.	A substrate of an inch or two of soil, peat, peat or soil mixed with sand, or vermiculite can be used in the bottom of the tank for a pet praying mantis.  This will help retain moisture.	\N	\N	\N	This is one of the most important aspects of husbandry and one that can vary with different species.  Some species are tolerant of variations but some have very specific needs, so check your species! The commonly kept African praying mantis (the species listed above) should be kept at 70-86 F (21-30 C).  If additional heat is necessary a small undertank heating mat can be used (as sold for reptiles and hermit crabs). For species caresheets try DeShawn\'s Mantid Kingdom .	Most mantids will get their water intake by drinking water droplets off vegetation provided by misting (some may use the water dish).
Red Eared Sliders	\N	\N	\N	\N	The length of the claws is the primary way to tell the difference between males and females, as they are much longer in males. See Sexing Red Eared Sliders for other details that can help you tell the difference. The differences are not marked until they read sexual maturity, though.	\N	up to 12 inches in length (measured as the carapace, or top shell, length).	\N	A good quality complete reptile vitamin and mineral supplement should be added to the food once or twice a week. In addition, extra calcium can be provided by giving turtles a cuttlebone (break into pieces and float in the water) or calcium block to nibble on.	\N	\N	\N	\N
Red Footed Tortoises	\N	Red footed tortoises live up to 50 years, possibly longer.	\N	\N	This species does not hibernate.  Care Sheets Online: Red-Footed Tortoise (http://chelonia.org/Articles/redfootcare.htm) - by Darrell Senneke and Chris Tabaka DVM, a thorough care sheet.Feeding Red-Foot and Yellow- Foot Tortoises (http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/feeding_redfoots.html) - by Andy Highfield, a guide to diet considerations and recommendations.Redfoot Tortoise (http://www.turtlebunker.com/Index-7.htm) - by Felice Rood, a good basic guide to care of this species.	\N	Red footed tortoises often reach a length of 10-14 inches, although they can be larger (16 inches or more). A slightly smaller \"dwarf\" variety is also being sold, commonly called the cherry-head that only attains a length of 10 - 12 inches as an adult. They can reach weights up to 30 pounds.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Savannah Monitors	\N	\N	\N	in addition to the incandescent basking light, provide a full spectrum UVA/UVB light for 10-12 hours per day.	\N	\N	\N	indoor/outdoor carpeting or brown butcher paper are the most practical for cleaning up after these somewhat messy lizards (they eat a lot and defecate a lot). Some use bark or gravel, but you must ensure that the monitors are not ingesting the substrate accidentally with their meals.	\N	\N	\N	gradient from 85-90 F (29-32 C) with a basking spot of 95-100 F (35-39 C). A combination of under tank heating and a basking light on one side of the tank works well. Make sure the appropriate temperature gradient is provided by measuring temperatures in various spots around the tank. Night temperature can drop to 75-85 F (24-29 C). Do not use basking lights to achieve night time temperatures - use heating pads and/or ceramic heating elements.	provide a large shallow sturdy water dish - ideally large enough to allow them to submerge themselves. They will often defecate in their water so frequent cleaning is required.
Scorpion	\N	6-8 years	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	a gradient should be provided, from about 70-90 F.Many recommend occasionally allowing temperatures of about 100 F.The temperature gradient is important to allow the scorpions to regulate their body temperature as needed.  The easiest way to provide the gradient is by using a heating mat designed for use under reptile tanks.This should be placed under no more than about 1/3 of the tank, so the scorpion can move from warmer to cooler temperatures if desired.Always verify that appropriate temperatures are being provided by using accurate thermometers in a few location within the cage. Being nocturnal,scorpions do not have a requirement for UV lighting, and prefer a light-dark cycle with a slightly longer dark period.	\N
Short Tailed Opossums	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Sugar Gliders	\N	\N	\N	\N	If a sugar glider is not tame when acquired, time, patience, and gentle frequent training sessions will eventually allow bonding of the glider to its owner.Gliders adore being near their owners, inside a shirt (hint wear two shirtsand let the glider hang out between them, or else their claws will tickleor scratch!) or in a pocket. They will be lovely companions, whoview you as an equal. Sugar gliders do not respond at all to punishmentor domination, so treat them with respect, gentleness and understanding,and you will be rewarded with a devoted companion!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Three Toed Box Turtle	\N	As with other box turtles, three toed box turtles can be very long-lived, possibly up to 100 years.  Sadly, many in captivity will not survive that long (30-40 years is more typical; even shorter with less than ideal care).	\N	If kept in an outdoor pen, make sure there are both sunny and shady areas available (the turtle should be able to move from cooler to warmer areas as necessary).  Indoors, a terrarium will need a heat source as well as a UVB emitting reptile light.	Three toed box turtles can live in a wide variety of habitats from woodlands to meadows, but are usually found near a water source.  They often venture into shallow water, perhaps moreso than other North American box turtles.  As with other North American box turtles, three toed box turtle hibernate when it is colder (in warmer climates they stay active longer). They are found from Missouri south to Texas and Alabama.  Box turtle populations are declining (listed by CITES as threatened, and import/export permits are necessary).  Many states protect box turtle populations and have laws against collecting box turtles from the wild.  It is best to get a pet box turtle bred in captivity from a reputable breeder.  Wild caught turtles do not adjust well to captivity and many die from the stress. Pet stores often carry wild caught turtles.	Males often have red or orange markings on the head and sometimes the neck and forelegs.  They also have longer, thicker tails than the females. In addition, the plastron is slightly concave in males and flatter in females.  Males have red irises.  Typically, the the claws on the hind feet are  shorter and more curved than those on the females.	about 3.5 to 5 inches in length	\N	\N	\N	\N	Provide a basking spot with temperatures of 85 - 88 F, maintaining the terrarium with a gradient down to about 75 F.  The nightime temperature should not drop below 70 F.	It is not unusual for three toed box turtles to wade into shallow water to drink and have a soak, perhpas moreso than other North American species.  Provide a large shallow pan of clean water at all times, but make sure they can easily get in and out of the water without tipping (or drowning, of course).  Regularly mist their pen or run a sprinkler for added moisture, as three toed box turtles prefer a bit more humidity than others.

Tokay Geckos	\N	Tokay geckos can be expected to live 10 years or more (up to 20 has been reported).	\N	\N	Wild caught tokay geckos are likely to be stressed and parasite infested. It is a good idea to take your new gecko to a vet soon after purchasing it, or at least a fecal sample to check for parasites.	\N	Tokay geckos are large, at around 12 inches adult length.	Orchid bark or coconut husk based substrate are good choices for their moisture retaining qualities.	\N	Being a larger lizard a 20 gallon tank is the minimum size recommended for tokay geckos. Provide sturdy branches for climbing, and strong potted plants can be added (artificial plants could also be used). Also provide some hiding spots using cork bark, half logs, or caves.	\N	Aim for 80-90 F (27-32) during the day (as a gradient) and down to 70-80 F (21-27) at night. No UVB emitting bulbs are necessary;  an incandescent bulb can be used for heat during the day, but a noucturnal reptile bulb or ceramic element must be used for heat at night. Heat provided from above the tank is preferable since tokay geckos tend to climb.	\N
Veiled Chameleons	\N	approximately 5 years in captivity.	\N	Chameleons need an ultraviolet (UVA/UVB) light source, so invest in a good bulb such as the Zoomed\'s Reptisun 5.0. Keep the UV light on for 10-12 hours per day. Remember these bulbs need to be replaced every 6 months.  Chameleons also benefit from spending time outdoors in natural sunlight when the temperatures are warm enough (but beware of over heating -- make sure shade is always available).	\N	\N	Veiled chameleon males can reach 18-24 inches in total length (about 12 inches snout to vent length), while females tend to be quite a bit smaller at 10-13 inches (just 4-6 inches in snout to vent length).	Cleanliness in the cage is vital, to prevent bacterial or mold growth. Using paper towels or newspaper to line the cage makes cleaning easiest.  Potted plants can be placed on a plain paper substrate for easier cleaning while still allowing live planting in the cage. Do not use wood chips or any other substrate that could be accidentally ingested and cause blockages.	\N	\N	\N	For veiled chameleons a daytime temperature gradient of about 80-90 F (26-32 C) should be provided, with a basking spot at 95 F (35 C). At night, they should have a temperature drop of about 10-15 F (5-10 C). If your home doesn\'t drop below 65-70 F (18-21 C) at night, heating at night isn\'t necessary.  Heating is best accomplished by a basking or incandescent light in a reflector or a ceramic heat element, any of which should be placed outside of the cage to prevent burns.	\N
White lined Geckos	\N	White lined geckos may be expected to live 10-20 years or so, though they are realtively new to the reptile hobby so this is a bit uncertain.	\N	White lined geckos are nocturnal so do not need special UV lighting.  However, many experts feel providing  low levels  of UV lighting is still beneficial to their overall health.  You must ensure, however, that the geckos can hide from the light if desired. A red night time bulb allows viewing when they are most active.	White lined geckos tend to be less aggressive than their close relative, tokay geckos.  They are pretty fast, somewhat delicate, and will bite if feeling threatened, so care is required when handling.	\N	\N	The substrate for white lined geckos should be something that retains moisture to aid in humidity levels, such as coconut fiber bedding, cypress mulch, moss, or peat, though paper or paper towels can be used as well.	\N	\N	\N	A daytime temperature  gradient  of 82-85 F (27-29.5 C) should be provided for white lined geckos, with a drop at nightime to 70-75 F (21-24 C).  A heat lamp or ceramic heat emitter makes a good heat source for day time; at night a red night time bulb or cermic heat emitter is a good choice.  Undertank heat can also be used.  Do not rest a heat source right the top of the tank, as these climbing geckos could get too close and burns could result.	\N
White\'s Tree Frog	\N	15 years (up to 20 years has been reported)	\N	\N	Good choice for beginning frog owners. White\'s tree frogs are native to Australia, Indonesia and New Guinea. They are nocturnal, so will be more active in the evening and night hours.	\N	4-5 inches	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
