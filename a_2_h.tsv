African Clawed Frogs	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	These frogs will take many kinds of foods, live or not. Many owners are feeding floating reptile sticks with success. While these are relatively well balanced, feeding a variety of food is still a good idea. Items such as bloodworms, waxworms, earthworms, feeder fish such as guppies, brine shrimp, and dog and cat food can all be fed. In addition, a commercial food for clawed frogs can be purchased via mail order from companies such as Xenopus Express (http://www.xenopus.com/) (these frogs are used fairly extensively in research so are available along with supplies quite readily). As long as a balanced food is used as the basis for the diet, supplementation with vitamins and minerals is not necessary.  Feed the amount they will clear from the water in 10-15 minutes, daily. Some sources say fully grown frogs only need to feed 3-4 times a week. In general over feeding is more of a problem than under feeding, so you can feed daily and keep an eye on the body shape of your frog--if it seems to be getting overweight, then you can cut back a bit.  Clawed frogs often become quite tame over time, taking food directly from the fingers of their owners. They do sometimes accidentally nibble on the fingers, but lack teeth so this is not a big problem. These frogs are also lack tongues, and feed by stuffing food into their mouths with their front legs. They can be quite messy as a result!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	There are many variations in recommendations for tank size for these critters, but being a fairly large frog they will need a good sized tank. Approximately 10 gallons per frog is a good rule of thumb. The frogs are strictly aquatic and do not need a land area. However, the water should only be about 12 inches (30 cm) deep so that the frog will be able to easily reach the surface, as they must breathe oxygen at the surface (a minimum of 6 inches is recommended to allow the frog room to maneuver). A secure lid is also a must - these frogs are adept at propelling themselves out of the water and escaping, given the chance.	\N
African Pygmy Dormouse	A little pet that is becoming more popular as a pet is the dormouse, most commonly the African dormouse (Graphiurus murinus). These little rodents are also called the African dwarf dormice, African pygmy dormice, and sometimes even micro squirrels.  Dormice are small squirrel-like animal. Their body length is a mere 3-4 inches or so, and they have a bushy tail that is almost as long as their body. They are nocturnal and get quite active at night. African dormice have a life expectancy of around 5-6 years in captivity.  Dormice are social animals, and should be kept in groups of two or more. Same sex groups usually get along well, as long as they are raised together from a young age.  Dormice can be hand tamed, although regular interaction from an early age is is the best way to ensure a pet that enjoys handling. While they may not want to be held they will climb all over their humans. Using a favorite treat as bribery helps, too.	\N	\N	\N	\N	In the wild, dormice eat a variety of foods including nuts and seeds, fruit, birds eggs, and insects. A good variety seems to be the key to keeping dormice in captivity, although specific feeding recommendations vary by reference.  The main groups of foods to be included in the diet are a seed mix (such as that made for hamsters or other small rodents, with sunflower seeds or raw peanuts added), fruits and vegetables, and protein sources such as hard boiled egg, feeder insects (mealworms, crickets), cooked chicken, and yogurt. The seed mix can be fed daily, but make sure the dormice do not fill up on seeds and nuts and refuse other essential parts of the diet. Fruits and vegetables can be fresh, frozen or dried. Fresh foods can be offered in the evening and any uneaten bits removed the next morning to prevent spoilage.  Different references I have read make different recommendations for feeding - from whether or not seeds should be offered in unlimited quantities to how often fruits/vegetables and protein foods should be fed. I do not have any personal experience with these animals, but in general as varied a diet as possible is often the best way to prevent pets from becoming fussy eaters and maintaining a healthy balance. Therefore, I\'d recommend feeding a variety of foods from each group (seeds/nuts, fruits and vegetables, and proteins) on a daily basis.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	These little creatures are excellent escape artists and can sneak through a very small opening. The best type of housing is a glass tank with a tight fitting, fine mesh top. During their active times they will get to the top of the cage, so make sure the top is secure! A 10 gallon tank will house 2 dormice adequately, although being active animals they will appreciate the additional room of a 20 gallon tank. If keeping more than two, a larger tank is a necessity.  The tank should be lined with a relatively thick layer of bedding such as a recycled paper bedding product or aspen shavings. Two inches provides a nice absorbent layer.  Because they naturally spend a lot of time in trees, branches should be provided for climbing. Ropes (suspend from cage top) and other wooden toys make a nice variety of opportunities for climbing and play. Also, a small rodent wheel can be provided for exercise (mouse sized). A solid surface wheel is a good choice to reduce the chance of their feet or tail getting caught.  Nest boxes are also necessary, to give the dormice a sense of security. Commercial small animal nest boxes can be purchased, or can be improvised. Cardboard tubes can be provided for hiding and play time.  A couple of heavy ceramic dishes can be provided for feeding. Most dormice will readily eat from dishes on the ground, but if necessary you can also hang a small dish or wicker basket from a branch for feeding. A small water bottle can be used, but the water should be changed regularly.  Dormice need to be kept at 70 F or above - at cooler temperatures (i.e. below around 65 F) they may begin to hibernate. In a captive animal that is not prepared, hibernation can be dangerous.	\N
African Fat Tailed Geckos	\N	\N	Fat tailed geckos show two main patterns -- one with a white stripe down back, and one without. They come in several colours, with dark and light brown being most common. The most notable feature is the large, thick tail (used for fat storage).	Care Sheets: African Fat-Tailed Geckos (http://www.paulfirlotte.com/fattail.html) --  Paul Firlotte; Fat-Tailed Geckos (http://www.anapsid.org/fattailgecko.html) -- Ron Hatcher.	African Fat-Tailed Geckos (http://www.paulfirlotte.com/fattail.html) --  Paul Firlotte; Fat-Tailed Geckos (http://www.anapsid.org/fattailgecko.html) -- Ron Hatcher.	Fat tailed geckos can be fed primarily on crickets and mealworms, although adults can be offered the occasional superworm or waxworm. Prey should be always be gut loaded prior to feeding, and dusted with a vitamin supplement containing calcium. Adults can be fed every 2-3 day, and juveniels every 1-2 days. Provide a shallow dish with water as well.	\N	Fat tailed geckos are nocturnal. They are usually quite docile though they can be shy. Never house males together.	\N	\N	\N	\N	should be quite high (over 50\\%) and maintained by misting several times a week and providing a shallow water dish at all times. A humidity retreat is also a good idea (e.g. a small container with damp spaghum moss inside).
African Pygmy Hedgehog	The hedgehogs commonly kept as pets in North America appear to by a mix of species, originally native to Africa. The term \"African Pygmy Hedgehog\" is a descriptive term (coined by breeders), rather than a true species name.They are considered primarily insectivores (insects make up the largest part of their natural diet).Their backs are covered with rows of short prickly spines and their bellies are covered with soft fur. When threatened, they roll in to a tight ball with just a mass of spines poking out. When relaxed, the spines lay almost flat.Thanks to selective breeding, hedgehogs are now available in a huge array of color variations (http://www.hedgehogclub.com/colorguide.html).They are quite compact, reaching a size of around 5-8 inches in length.Estimates of expected life span vary widely, anywhere from 3-8 years, although 4-6 years is probably most typical.Illegal in some areas.Fairly low maintenance pets, and while they don\'t mind handling once used to it they don\'t really seem to \"crave\" human interaction.| It is best to locate a reputable breeder who breeds for good temperament and makes sure young hedgehogs are handled regularly.Getting a young hedgehog (6-8 weeks) is the best way to make sure your hedgehog will get used to being handled.If possible, try to pick up the hedgehog to gauge its reaction - try to choose one that will allow itself to be picked up and maybe even turned on its back without rolling into a tight ball and staying there.Look for bright eyes, clear nostrils, and healthy looking skin, quills and fur. Watch out for flaky skin, missing quills, discharge around the eyes or nose, or evidence of diarrhea. Also make sure the hedgehog is in good body condition - neither too thin nor overweight (a good place to check is around the legs - watch out for rolls of fat as obesity is a common problem).Males and females generally are equally good pets.Plan on only one hedgehog to a cage. Most hedgehogs are perfectly happy to be kept alone and in fact often fight if kept with other hedgehogs.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
African Spurred Tortoise	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sulcata tortoises are herbivorous, grazing tortoises and need a high fiber/low protein diet, provided with a variety of grasses and hays (at least 75\\% of diet) along with some edible weeds and flowers (dandelions, clover, endive, edible flowers, weeds, cactus pads). Small amounts of other leafy green vegetables are probably okay, but avoid foods high in oxalates (spinach, mustard and beet greens, kale, broccoli, and cauliflower). Do not feed fruits, animal protein, or tortoise foods.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Outdoors, these large turtles need a sturdy fence and since they burrow the fence should be extended underground. Shelter in the form of a doghouse or small shed will provide protection from the elements. Building a heated shed will provide a suitable shelter for colder weather. Daytime temperatures can be up to 100 F (37 C), but they should have a heated shelter if the night time temperature drops below 70 F (21 C). A shallow pan of water should be provided, and a muddy wallow may be used as well.  Indoors, with the size of these turtles, housing adults indoors gets a bit impractical. An outdoor heateed shed or greenhouse where they can live when it is cooler is sometimes a better option. Temperatures should be maintained at 80-90 F (27-32) during the day, dropping as low as 72 F (22C) at night. In addition, a basking spot should be provided at 95 F (35 C). A UVA/UVB light is also necessary when housed indoors. A pan of water should be provided.	\N
Alpacas	In the article \"Llamas as Companion Animals,\" the characteristics and uses of the llama were discussed. This time we\'ll take a look at its smaller relative, the alpaca. Again, these are on a fine line between livestock and pets, but they have good components and shows are becoming more popular.  Nevertheless, they are best suited to farms and acreages as a decent facility and pasture will be needed.  Alpacas are members of the camel family, along with llamas, vicunas,guanacos, and camels. They arose in South America through selective breeding (although it is believed that, as with other camelids, their distant ancestors migrated from North America), and are quite close in size and fiber type to the wild vicuna. They are quite a bit smaller than llamas, and have a gentle, curious disposition. Their fibre is very fine, soft, and highly valued by the textile trade. There are two types of alpacas with very different fleece appearances; the huacaya,whose fibre is very soft and crimped appearing puffy, and the suri (http://www.bonnydoonalpacas.org/suri.html),which has straight fibre that falls from the body and ends up in curls that give the appearance of dreadlocks. Both types of fleece are valued, although the suri type is much less common (estimated less than10\\% of the world\'s alpaca population). The fleece, in addition to being extremely soft, is also estimated to be 5 times warmer than wool,and is very light.  Although the primary domestic use for the alpaca is it\'s fibre, they are increasingly popular as companion and show animals. Since they are much less common than llamas, they are harder to find and a little more expensive. However, there are a number alpaca qualities that make them suitable for those who want a few primarily as companion animals.They are quite a bit smaller than llamas, standing only about two and half to three feet at the shoulder, and weighing in at 100-190 lbs.(llamas are more like 250-400 lbs.), which makes them a little more manageable.Their disposition is much like llamas. They have a calm, gentle and predictable personality. They will tend to spit at each other if disgruntled about something, but will rarely spit at a human. Aggressive behavior is rare (watch for foot stomping and kicking). They can be taught to lead on a halter and other simple commands. They are sociable, so you will need to have more than one. By nature they are pack animals and will huddle together if nervous or frightened.They produce several vocalizations but the one most owners find most charming is their humming - in different tones for different situations.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Alpacas are hardy animals, and do well in most climates. A decent,well fenced pasture will be necessary, as well as some sort of shelter.A good quality, relatively low protein forage, with some supplementation will take care of dietary needs (it is best to have locally available feed analyzed for nutrient content and supplement accordingly). Routine veterinary care and maintenance such as nail trimming, tooth care, and shearing will also be necessary. Otherwise, these are fairly easy animals to look after.	\N
American Green Tree Frogs	\N	\N	\N	A minimum 10 gallon tank is suitable as a cage for green tree frogs, although larger is fine.Keep in mind they are arboreal, so the height of the cage is more important than the floor space, so a tall tank is best.Need a secure cover to prevent escape (mesh or wire is fine).	\N	Green tree frogs are generally good eaters and feed exclusively on insects.Crickets can make up the bulk of the diet.Crickets and other food insects should be gut loaded (fed nutritious foods before feeding them to the frogs). For more on dealing with crickets as prey see \"Raising Crickets for Food.\"In addition to gut loading, the crickets should be dusted with a calcium and multivitamin supplement a couple of times a week.Fruit flies, houseflies, moths and other insects can also be fed if available.Tree frogs will likely eat more in the spring and summer months than in the winter. Smaller frogs should be fed daily, while larger frogs can be fed daily or every other day, using body condition as a guide (i.e. if getting obese, cut down the feedings).	opportunity for climbing is very important, so provide a variety of branches and live or artificial plants for climbing. Live plants to consider include philodendrons or sturdy ferns. Ensure any wood collected from the outdoors is pesticide free, and collected wood must be treated (http://www.anapsid.org/wildwood.html) to remove harmful bacteria or bugs.  Driftwood and cork bark also make good cage furnishings.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Anoles	Sometimes also called American chameleons, although they are not true chameleons. They can do a color change from green to brown, especially when stressed.Quite readily available in the pet trade.Life span averages around 4 years, although they can live longer (up to 8 or more years if well cared for).Adult length of around 8 inches (including tail) in captivity (typically slightly larger in the wild).Males are larger than females and have a large dewlap (flap of skin) on the throat that is used in behavioral displays.Usually inexpensive to buy an anole, but the equipment needed to set up a proper tank is quite costly.Reasonably easy to care for if you can set up a proper tank.Can be very stressed by handling, and can drop their tails if grabbed by the tail.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Anoles are insectivores and are generally good eaters.While crickets can be the main part of the diet, it is best to feed a variety of insects. Wild caught insects can be offered as well, if pesticide free.Crickets must be gut loaded with nutritious food prior to feeding. See \"Raising Crickets for Food.\"Feed appropriate sized prey items - about 1/2 the size of the anole\'s head is a good guideline.Can usually feed every other day, and 2-3 appropriately sized items per feeding.Crickets and other prey should be dusted with a quality vitamin/mineral supplement.	Live plants help maintain humidity and provide cover - try Sansevierias (snake plants), bromeliads, philodendrons, ivy, orchids and vines.  Pieces of bark and branches should also be provided for climbing and basking.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Anoles can be housed in a fairly small tank - a 10 gallon is sufficient for a single anole, or perhaps a pair. Larger is better, and if housing multiple anoles, lots of space is necessary. You should only keep one male anole per tank. Females will get along fine, as long as the tank is roomy enough and there plenty of basking spots and places to hide. A secure fitted lid is necessary.	a humidity level of 60-70\\% is necessary for anoles. This can usually be achieved by misting the inside of the tank daily. It is a good idea to measure the humidity level to make sure it is adequate for anoles. Misting systems are available although they are quite expensive. If you are having a hard time maintaining the humidity level, try covering part of the top of the tank and/or increasing the number of live plants. Misting also provides drinking water for the anoles as they often will not drink from a bowl (they will lick droplets of water off the misted plants).
Axolotls	The Axolotl may not a common pet, but it is very unique. The axolotl is a type of salamander, native to Mexico. The common pet or laboratory Axolotl refers exclusively to A. mexicanum, although in Mexico the term Axolotl is used in reference to several species of Ambystoma,and is considered an edible food source!  The Axolotl is neotenic, meaning that it doesn\'t routinely undergo metamorphosis from the larval to adult form, as happens with most other salamanders.Instead, the larval form (with gills) becomes sexually mature and reproduces,maintaining a strictly aquatic life style. Under some circumstances,the Axolotl can undergo metamorphosis into a terrestrial from, although this can be stressful on the animal.  The Axolotl has amazing regenerative abilities - if injured, even to the point of losing a body part, the Axolotl will heal readily and even regenerate lost bits. They are fairly hardy creatures that can be expected to live up to 10-15 years with attention to proper care, particularly with respect to water quality. Their skin and gills are very sensitive and quite soft, so handling is not recommended.  Juvenile axolotls can be cannibalistic towards each other, so they are best raise din separate enclosures. Adults can potentially be housed together but watch for cannibalistic tendencies. Of course, if a body part gets bitten off by a tank mate, an axolotl can regenerate it over time.	\N	\N	\N	\N	In the wild, axolotls feed on snails, worms, crustaceans, small fish, and small amphibians.In captivity, they can be fed brine shrimp, small strips of beef or liver,earthworms (wild caught worms can carry parasites), bloodworms, tubifex worms, or commercial fish pellets (e.g. salmon or trout pellets). If feeding these fresh items it is best to feed a variety to get a better balance in the diet. You can also get special axolotl feeding pellets from the Indiana University Axolotl Colony (http://bigapple.uky.edu/~axolotl/food.htm). Uneaten food should be cleaned from the tank daily.  Terrestrial Axolotls: Axolotls do occasionally undergo metamorphosis to take on the terrestrial form. The conditions under which this would happen naturally is poorly understood. They can be induced using changes in water characteristics,or by supplementing with certain proportions of thyroid hormone.Of course the terrestrial form of the axolotl has a completely different set of care requirements. Trying to induce metamorphosis is not recommended,as this can place undue stress on the creature, and can significantly shorten its life span.  Axolotls are used fairly extensively in laboratory settings, primarily to study their regenerative capabilities, and are relatively easy to breed in captivity. Unfortunately, wild axolotls are now considered critically endangered,suffering from the effects of shrinking habitat, exploitation, pollution, and introduction of non-native predators.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Ball Pythons	The ball python is a good snake for a beginning snake owner. Growing to a maximum size of 3-5 feet, ball pythons are not as large as many of the other constricting snakes that are kept as pets, and are quite docile and easy to handle. A captive bred ball python usually flourishes given the proper care.  Ball pythons are so named because when threatened they roll themselves into a tight ball, tucking their head inside their coils.  Ball pythons are somewhat notorious for refusing to feed, but many believe that is a much larger problem with wild caught specimens. In addition, wild caught snakes tend to be very stressed from capture and transport and often harbor a large parasite load. Captive bred snakes tend to be more expensive and sometimes harder to find, but they are well worth the extra cost.	\N	Look for a young, captive bred snake - you may have to find a breeder for this. Choose a snake that has a well rounded body, clean eyes and vent, and that shows no signs of respiratory problems (wheezing, bubbles around nostrils). Look for one that is alert and curious and gently grips your hand/arms when handled (they may be skittish but should calm after handling for a bit). It is not a bad idea to ask for a feeding demonstration to be sure the snake readily takes a meal.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Bearded Dragons	Popular as pets, bearded dragons or \"beardies\" are moderately sized lizards native to Australia. While they are generally considered good pets even for beginner reptile owners, they do have fairly complex nutritional and environmental requirements so need special equipment and a fair amount of time to care for properly. However, they are social and easy to tame and handle, and show a range of fascinating behaviors that make them interesting to watch.  Although several other species are becoming available to the pet trade,the most commonly available variety is the central or inland bearded dragon,Pogona vitticeps. This species is native to arid, rocky areas of Australia,and is typically tan/brown in coloration (several color morphs are also available). Their name is derived from the spines that line their throats. These spines usually lie flat but if the dragon feels threatened the throat is expanded causing the spines to stand up, making the dragon look more intimidating (especially combined with their tendency to flatten their bodies to appear wider). However, bearded dragons are generally docile, and their aggressive displays are rarely seen in captivity.They are noted for an endearing greeting behavior, in which they lift their front leg in an almost circular motion, so it looks like they are waving.  Virtually all bearded dragons available in America are captive bred,as Australia has strict laws against exportation of its wildlife.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Blue Tongued Skinks	Several species of blue tongued skinks, but the most commonly found in the pet trade are subspecies of Tiliqua scincoides, especially Tiliqua scincoides scincoides, the common or eastern blue tongued skink (information on this page refers primarily to this species).Fairly large at mature size of around 20 inches (snout to vent length of 12 inches).Life span of 10-20 years.Ground dwellers with a flattened, elongated body (somewhat resembles a snake in appearance).Quite docile and gentle, and quite easily tamed and handled.	\N	\N	Need a large enclosure such as a 40-55 gallon tank.Being ground dwellers they don\'t need branches for climbing, but still need a secure lid.	\N	Skinks are true omnivores, which should be reflected in their diet.Variety is the key to providing a nutritious diet, and a calcium/vitamin D supplement should be added to the food.Melissa Kaplan recommends a balance of about 60\\% vegetable/fruits and 40\\% meat items.Vegetables/fruits: beans, summer or winter squash, carrots, parsnips, leafy greens. Can be shredded or pureed and added to meat portion of diet. Fruits can include strawberries, bananas, melon, etc.Meats: low fat canned dog food is a good staple in the diet. This should be supplemented with other items such as superworms and pinkie mice (larger for adults).	\N	\N	\N	\N	a couple of sturdy hiding spots should be provided for skinks, which like to burrow and hide. Cork bark, wood, rocks, PVC pipes, or other hides can be used. Make sure wood pieces or rocks are firmly places so they will not fall on the lizard. A humidity hide (e.g. a plastic storage box with moss or cypress mulch to holds moisture) will help with sheds.	\N	\N
Boa Constrictor	There are several subspecies of boa constrictor (species name boa constrictor) that are found in the pet trade. Red tailed boas (Boa constrictor constrictor) are commonly found in the pet trade, and Boa constrictor imperator can be found as well, among other less common subspecies.	\N	\N	The care for all the species is fairly similar.  Before committing to ownership of a boa constrictor, be sure you will be able to handle the size and strength of a full grown snake for the 25-30 years your snake might live. A full grown boa constrictor (red tailed) will reach 8-10 feet long and weigh up to 50 pounds. These are very muscular and thick bodied snake. While generally quite docile in temperament, it is important to respect the inherent strength of these animals and that could inflict serious injury to a person.	\N	\N	\N	\N	As a general rule, for a constricting snake over 6-8 feet, it is a good idea to have a second person present while handling the snake, just in case assistance is required. Keep in mind also that large, secure housing is required for these snakes, and as adults need large prey such as large rats or even rabbits.	\N	\N	\N	\N
Burmese Python	\N	\N	\N	Care Sheets: Burmese Pythons (http://www.anapsid.org/burm.html) by Melissa Kaplan; Burmese Pythons (http://www.wnyherp.org/care-sheets/snakes/burmese-python.php) - the Western New York Herpetological Society	Burmese Pythons (http://www.anapsid.org/burm.html) by Melissa Kaplan; Burmese Pythons (http://www.wnyherp.org/care-sheets/snakes/burmese-python.php) - the Western New York Herpetological Society	Burmese pythons are usually good eaters and care must be taken not to overfeed or you will end up with an obese snake. Hatchlings can be fed mice or fuzzy rats, moving up to rats and eventually rabbits as the snake grows (feed prey pre-killed). The prey should be no larger than the width of the snake.  Hatchlings can be fed 1-2 times a week but adult snakes only need to be fed every 2 weeks or so. Feed often enough to maintain optimum body condition but be careful not to over feed as these snakes are prone to obesity.	\N	\N	These snakes should be handled frequently from a young age or else will be difficult to handle as they get larger. Handle gently but firmly and be persistent if the snake resists at first. However, avoid handling for a couple of days after feeding or your snake my regurgitate. If your python wraps itself around you, unwind it starting at the tail. As your snake grows, it is recommended that you have at least one other person present when handling or feeding these strong snakes (once over 8 feet long, you should always have a second person available to help with handling, and in fact it is a good idea to have a person present for for each 4 feet of snake (so 3 people to handle a 12 foot snake and 4 people for a 16 foot snake).	\N	\N	\N	\N
Chinese Water Dragon	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	You can feed crickets, mealworms, waxworms, earthworms, grasshoppers, butterworms, locusts, and possible small feeder fish. Adults can also be fed pinkie mice and kingworms. All insect prey should be gut loaded. Wild caught insects are best avoided due to the risk of containing pesticides, and always avoid fireflies as they are potentially toxic. A small amount (10-15 percent of the diet) of finely chopeed vegetables and fruit can also be offered. Try collards, dandelion, and mustard greens, sweet potato, parsnips, green beans, carrots, and yellow or orange squash. Fruits should be used in smaller quantities than vegetables; try strawberries, raspberries, mangos, papaya, figs, and cantaloupe.|  Hatchlings and juveniles should be fed daily, while as a general rule adults can be fed every 2 or 3 days. The best way to determine how much to feed is to look at body condition: skinny dragons need more to eat, and chubby dragons need to be fed less.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Corn Snake	Corn snakes make an excellent choice as a pet snake. Pet corn snakes are generally docile, relatively easy to care for, and do not get too large. They are excellent escape artists, however, so care must be taken when planning their housing.  Corn snakes do make a good choice for beginners since they are easy to handle and care for. However, they are also favorites with experienced keepers due to the vast array of beautiful colors and patterns selective breeding has produced. An excellent page with lots of photos of the different variations is Shawn Lockhart\'s Color and Pattern Variations of Corn Snakes (http://members.aol.com/guttata319/Hawkherp/morfs.html).  Corn snakes are closely related to rat snakes (rat snakes also belong to the genus Elaphe).  Sometimes corn snakes are also called red rat snakes, mainly the amelanistic (lacking brown or black coloration) variations. Corn snakes are native to the south eastern United States and are mainly land dwelling. They are active mainly at night or at dusk and dawn.	\N	\N	\N	\N	snakes are carnivores, which means owners must be be prepared to provide prey (in this case mice) to feed the snake.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Corn snakes do not have elaborate housing needs, but must be in an escape-proof enclosure.Legal issues: be sure to check the legality of exotic pets in your area.	\N
Crested Geckos	Crested geckos reach an adult length of around 7-9 inches (including their prehensile tails). They come in an wide array of colors and markings (morphs). They get their name from the fringed crest that runs from over their eyes down their necks and backs, though the size of the crest varies. They have specialized toe pads that allow them to effortlessly move along vertical surfaces, and their prehensile tails add to their agility. They are also good jumpers.	Crested geckos need room to climb, so provide a mix of branches, driftwood, cork bark, bamboo, and vines at a variety of heights and orientations. Add a variety of silk and/or sturdy live plants (pothos, philodendron, dracena, ficus) as they will hide in the plants for cover. A small shallow water dish can be provided, with fresh water daily, though they will likely prefer to drink water droplets from leaves (mist the tank every evening, at least -- see the humidity section).	\N	\N	\N	A commercial crested gecko diet is usually well-accepted and is the easiest way to ensure a well-balanced, nutritious diet. It can be supplemented with crickets and other prey insects (roaches, waxworms, silk worms; mealworms are best avoided due to their hard exoskelton) for variety and to allow the gecko to exercise its hunting instincts. Any insects fed should be slightly smaller than the space between the gecko\'s eyes, and should be gut loaded prior to feeding, and dusted with a calcium/D3 supplement.  If you can\'t get a commercial diet, you can feed crested geckos a combination of insect prey items and fruit, though it is more difficult to feed a balanced diet this way. The insect portion of the diet can be made up mainly of crickets, with the occasional addition of other insects for variety. Prey should be smaller than the space between the gecko\'s eyes, and should be gut loaded prior to feeding, and dusted with a calcium/D3 supplement two to three times a week and a multivitamin once a week. Feed as much prey at one time as the gecko eagerly eats. Fruit can be fed several times a week as well. Try mashed fruit or jarred baby food; they often like like bananas, peaches, nectarines, apricots, papaya, mangoes, pears, and passion fruit.  Feed in the evening; juveniles should be feed daily but adults do not need to be fed every day (3 times a week is recommended by many keepers).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	A minimum 20 gallon tall terrarium is sufficient for an adult, but larger is better. Crested geckos are arboreal and active, and need lots of vertical space for climbing, so a tall tank is preferred. 2-3 crested geckos can be housed in a tall 29 gallon terrarium (but males are territorial, so keep only one male per tank). A glass terrarium with a screened side for ventilation can be used, but some keepers prefer screened enclosures.	Crested geckos need a moderate to high humidity level; aim for 60-80 percent relative humidity (get a hygrometer and monitor levels as humidity is very important). Provide humidity with regular misting with warm filtered water.  Depending on your cage set up you may need to mist the cage a few times a day to keep the humidity up. Always make sure the cage is well-misted at night when the geckos are most active. Crested geckos will likely drink from water droplets left from the mist.
Degu	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The basis of a good degu diet is a combination of high quality chinchilla or guinea pig pellets, and rodent blocks. Grass hay (such as timothy hay) should be available all the time (you can get small hay racks to make this easier), and a small amount of alfalfa hay can also be offered. A variety of fresh vegetables can be given, especially sweet potato (peeled, uncooked), carrots, broccoli, leafy greens, green beans, and dandelion leaves (must be pesticide-free). These should be offered in small quantities only or they may cause diarrhea. Vegetables that are members of the cabbage family (cabbage, broccoli, brussel sprouts, kale) should be fed only in very small quantities and some degu experts advise avoiding them altogether.  Degus are prone to diabetes and are designed to eat a diet high in roughage and low in carbohydrates. Do not let your degus get overweight or obese, and keep sugary foods to a minimum.  Fruit should be avoided as a treat (including raisins) due to their high sugar content. For treats, most degus relish seeds (e.g. sunflower seeds), peanuts, and whole nuts in the shell. However, these should only be an occasional treat, due to the high fat content.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Eastern Box Turtle	The Eastern box turtle is usually about 4-6 inches in length. Eastern box turtles have a high domed carapace (shell) that is usually a darker brown with bright yellow, orange and/or red markings. On the plastron, there may be dark areas, especially on the margins of the scutes. The skin is brown with spots or splashes of yellow or red coloration, especially in males. There are four toes on the back feet.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Adult eastern box turtles are omnivores and can be fed a variety of items. Approximately half of their diet should be made up of vegetables, fruit, and hay/grasses. The remainder should be made up of low fat protein sources; whole live foods are ideal (earthworms, slugs, snails, meal worms, crickets, grasshoppers etc) but cooked lean meats and low fat dog food can be added as a supplement. Hatchlings are more carnivorous. More on feeding box turtles can be found in \"Feeding Box Turtles.\"	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	While it is possible to keep Eastern box turtles (especially hatchlings and juveniles) in a large indoor terrarium (most aquariums are too small), they do much better in outdoor enclosures where the climate is agreeable. They should have easy access to a shallow pan of water at all times. As well, they should have access to hiding spots, and loose litter for burrowing. See \"Outdoor Pens for Box Turtles\" for more on outdoor housing.	\N
Ferret	Females are called jills, and males are hobs. Baby ferrets are called kits. In North America, spayed females are sometimes called sprites and neutered males called gibs. A group of ferrets is a \"business of ferrets.\" Males tend to be larger than females in length and weight. Females are 13-14 inches long and weigh anywhere from 0.75 to 2.5 lbs, whereas males are on average 15-16 inches long and weigh 2-3.5 lbs if neutered and are even larger (4 or more lbs) if not neutered. Most ferrets obtained in North America are spayed or neutered and descented at a very young age before being sold. Ferrets sleep a large part of the day, commonly around 18 hours. They naturally tend to be active at dawn and dusk, but usually adapt their sleeping and active times to the fit the schedules of their owners.Ferrets are very playful, and are very entertaining to watch.Ferrets have relatively poor eyesight but a keen sense of smell and hearing. There are often misconceptions and debate about whether ferrets are domesticated animals, and the short answer is yes, they are domesticated. They have been domesticated for probably 2000 years or more, and were brought to America as pets as long as 300 years ago.  Nevertheless, in many places they are still not recognized as a domestic animal for the purposes of laws pertaining to animals kept in captivity. The domestic ferret is sometimes also confused with its wild cousin, the black footed ferret.  Ferrets have an undeserved reputation of being smelly.  It is true that they have a distinctly musky odor about them, but it is neither offensive nor overpowering. This musky odor comes from their skin glands and is present whether the ferret is descented or not.  While occasional baths are recommended, frequent bathing will not reduce the scent, and will likely make it worse as the skin will get too dry and the skin glands will produce more oils in an effort to combat the dryness.  As mentioned above ferrets are usually descented in North America, which involved removal of the scent glands. They do have scent glands similar to skunk scent glands, and they will release (not spray) the contents if threatened. However, ferret scent gland secretions are milder than that of skunks and the smell dissipates quickly and washes away easily. The routine removal of scent glands, which is most commonly done in North America, is now being questioned since the musky odor of ferrets is not due to the scent glands and discharge of their scent glands is not a big problem.  Did you Know?  The name ferret is derived from the latin furonem, which means \"thief.\" Ferret owners can attest that this is a well deserved name, as they will happily steal anything they can get their paws on and hide it in their house. Ferrets come from the same family (\"Mustelidae\") as badgers, wolverines, otters, mink, weasels, black footed ferrets and polecats. The distant ancestry of the domestic ferret is somewhat of a mystery, although they are very closely related to the European polecat. The scientific name for ferrets is a somewhat controversial area - Mustela putorius furo is traditionally used, although recent scientific evidence has suggested they should have a name of their own, Mustela furo. Ferret owners have a variety of fun nicknames for ferrets such as ferts, fuzzies, carpet sharks, furballs, and more!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Fiddler Crab	The group of crabs known as fiddler crabs actually encompasses over90 species and subspecies of the genus Uca that come from a varietyof locations.  Males and females are quite easily distinguished by their claws -the females have small claws, but the males have one verylarge claw (see photos of males and females). The largest fiddler crabs only reach a mature size of about 2 inches across their body.| Fiddler crabs can be found on ocean beaches in the inter-tidal zone, retreating to muddy burrows as the tide goes out (so are exposed to water that ranges from brackish to salt water), while other species are found in brackish water swamps.  Fiddler crabs are scavengers, feeding on organic matter that they find on the surface of rocks and in the mud.| The fiddler crabs found in pet stores are most likely semi-terrestrial brackish crabs, which means they need somesalt in their water as well as access to air and dry land. Unfortunately, many pet stores keep fiddlers in a freshwater aquatic set up, and recommend the same to new owners. They may do fine in a fresh water and fully aquatic set up for weeks, but will eventually become weak and die. If possible, find a store that keeps them in brackish water, or wait for a new shipment so their time spent in fresh water is minimal. Look for crabs that are active and have all their legs and claws.	\N	\N	Some provision should be made to provide the crabs with access to land/air. Owners that do not do this often find their crabs crawling up the filter intake and into or on top the filter in an attempt to find land.  Providing a sloped bottom to the tank with part of the gravel or sand out of the water works well. Alternatively, use a partly filled tank with large rocks on which the crabs can climb out of the water.  Signs of health in fiddler crabs include growth and regular molting. Once a crab molts, their previous exoskeleton will likely be whole in the tank, looking eerily like a ghost. It is a good idea to leave the exoskeleton in the tank, at least for a week or so.  Often the crabs will ingest part of the shed exoskeleton, and it serves as an excellent source of calcium (which they need to produce their new exoskeletons).  Claws and legs may be lost but will regenerate over a couple of molts.  Fiddler crabs may produce eggs in captivity (thefemale carries eggs on her belly), but successful rearing of the youngin the aquarium is next to impossible due to the way their natural live cycle works (the larvae grow in deeper ocean waters and return to shore at maturity).	\N	In the wild fiddler crabs are scavengers, eating bits of organic matter they find in the sand/mud. In captivity, they can be fed sinking crab food, fish food meant for scavengers (sinking tablets, shrimp pellets, etc), and freeze dried plankton and shrimp.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Fire Bellied Toads	Oriental fire bellied toads are hardy little toads that are suitable for beginners. They are not difficult to care for, although they do take a fair amount of work to maintain. Native to southern and southeastern Asia, they are noted for their bright green and black coloration on their backs, and brilliant orange and black on their underside. These bright colors serve as a warning to predators (as in \"I\'m toxic!\"). While not the most toxic of amphibians, regular handling is not recommended (avoid if there are cuts on your hands) and your hands should always be washed thoroughly immediately after touching the frog (or cleaning the tank for that matter). It is not recommended to house these toads with other species due to potential toxicity problems, though. Regular cleaning and water changes will help keep the toxins from building up in the tank.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Fire bellied toads do not have extendable tongues, so use their mouths to grab their food and stuff it into their mouths with their forelegs. They will take a variety of prey items, including crickets and other insects, worms (such as waxworms and earthworms - mealworms are probably best avoided due to their tough exoskeleton), and even some small feeder fish such as guppies. Prey should be gut loaded, and dusted with a multivitamin powder. These toads generally have good appetites and usually do not have a problem eating in captivity. Adults typically only need to eat 2-3 times a week, and watch that the frogs do not become overweight.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	A minimum 10 gallon tank is recommended, although 2-3 frogs can be housed in a tank of this size. A larger number of frogs will happily live together in a larger tank (allow about 4 gallons of tank space per frog, and the long style aquariums provide more \"floor space\" for their size). A secure lid is a necessity, as these active little frogs will escape given the chance. The top should allow adequate ventilation.  A semi aquatic tank is the ideal set up, with 1/3 - 1/2 of the tank as a land area and the remainder as water about 2-4 inches deep. The land area could have rocks (which should be smooth to prevent injury to delicate frog skin), damp moss, plants and some areas to hide.  The water should have a filter, and frequent water changes are necessary. Use only dechlorinated stale (let sit 24 hours) water or bottled spring water in the tank. These frogs produce quite a bit of waste so frequent partial water changes should be done. Smooth gravel can be used to line the water side, and live or artificial plants can be used.  A heater is not usually necessary as these frogs can handle room temperature, although warmer temperatures are considered more ideal by some (75-78 F or 24-25 C). A basking area can be set up with a low wattage lamp (use a thermometer and aim for about 78 F).	\N
Flying Squirrel	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Provide branches in the cage, for both climbing and chewing. Cotton ropes hung in the cage also provide opportunity for climbing and play. Nest boxes should be provided along with facial tissues or paper towel for nesting material (avoid anything with threads that could wrap around and damage a leg).  The bottom of the cage can be lined with bedding or litter appropriate for rodents (i.e. no cedar shavings) As mentioned above, branches can be used as chew toys, as can wood pieces, wood parrot toys, etc. Whole, hard shelled nuts also provide chewing opportunities as well as being tasty treats.  A running wheel is also recommended for exercise. A solid surface wheel such as the Wodent Wheel (http://www.transoniq.com/) is the safest choice.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Since Southern flying squirrel are not large they can make do with a fairly small cage, but to thrive they need room to run and climb. Vertical space is more important than floor space though, so a tall cage is best. A cage designed for sugar gliders can work well, as long as the spacing in the mesh is narrow (1/2 inch by 1 inch at most). Some owners find that a homemade cage works well too. Keep in mind that Southern flying squirrels are excellent chewers, so make sure they cannot chew their way out of their cage (any wood or plastic should be covered with wire). Floor space of 2 feet by 2 feet is adequate, but the taller the cage, the better.	\N
Gerbils	\N	Provide lots of materials for climbing and enrichment, such as thick pieces of wood, stable rocks, ladders, ramps and platforms. Toys should also be provided that are safe for chewing (i.e. not plastic or with small bits that might be ingested). Wood toys or simple blocks of wood, branches, hay, wood and rope parrot toys, and small cardboard boxes are all good choices. Toilet paper tubes, though quickly destroyed, will likely be a favorite toy.  A water bottle, with a metal spout, can be hung on the cage. A fresh supply of water should always be available. Heavy ceramic food dishes are the best choice since they are harder to tip.  You can consider getting an exercise wheel, but get one with a solid surface to prevent injuries (some owners modify the typical hamster style wheel by applying tape over the wheel to provide a solid surface). There should be no place for the gerbil to catch its tail. You might even want to try something a little different like the Flying Saucer (http://qualitycage.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1_19&products_id=1803).	fairly small rodents with long furry tails that have a little tuft of fur at the end. The wild type coloration is \"agouti\", where each hair is banded with gray, yellowish, and black, with off-white hair on the belly.  However, through selective breeding, several lovely color variations are available.	\N	\N	Diet should consist of a good quality prepared gerbil diet supplemented with a loose seed mix and a variety of other foods. See Feeding Gerbils for more detail on appropriate foods.	\N	Mongolian gerbils are not nocturnal although they are sometimes active at night; they go through several sleep/active cycles in the course of 24 hours.  They are very curious and will explore anything, and can be quite entertaining.  To get a better understanding of gerbils, see Gerbil Behavior.	\N	\N	\N	For a pair of gerbils a cage about 12 inches by 24 inches (by 12 inches tall) is a good minimum size, but since gerbils are active, a larger cage is better. Glass aquariums can be used and are favored over wire cages by many owners. Aquariums allow a deep layer of bedding so the gerbils can burrow. A secure mesh lid is necessary to prevent escapes and allow ventilation. Wire cages can be used for gerbils, but they do have a tendency to kick the bedding out when the burrow, making a mess, and they sometimes chew on the wire resulting in sores on their noses. For wire cages, the bar spacing should be no more than 1/2 inch. Plastic cages do not hold up to the chewing habits of gerbils.	\N
Giant African Land Snails	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	A good sized, well-ventilated plastic or glass tank with a secure lid	\N
Giant African Millipedes	There are a variety of millipedes kept as pets that are generally called giant millipedes or giant African millipedes (e.g. Archispirostreptus spp, Scaphiostreptus spp). There are several species available, but there is often confusion over the exact species since species identification can be quite difficult in living specimens and there appears to be some dispute over the correct scientific names of some millipedes. However, while there is some variation in appearance, the giant millipedes are largely similar in their characteristics and care.  They have two main modes of defense if they feel threatened, they curl into a tight spiral and they secrete an irritating liquid from pores on their body. This liquid can be harmful if it gets in your eyes or mouth so you must wash your hands after handling a millipede. Some people are more sensitive to the liquid than others, and some species are more \"toxic\" than others.They can be handled, and are quite docile and slow moving.They get along fine with others so you can keep more than one per tank. They do breed quite readily so if you have males and females together you may find yourself with babies. Male millipedes have modified legs on the 7th body segment called gonopods. These legs look different than the other legs (they have grasping claws) and are often carried tucked up under the body.Millipedes do not actually have a thousand legs - they usually have between 100-400 (2 sets of legs per body segment). Each time they molt, they add more segments and therefore more legs.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Giant millipedes are herbivores, dining in the wild on decaying leaf material. In captivity they can be fed a variety of vegetables and fruits, cut into small pieces. Softer vegetables and fruits are best - try leaf lettuce, cucumber (reported as a favorite food of millipedes), tomatoes, melon, peaches, bananas, etc. The food can be fed in a shallow dish or jar lid. They prefer food that is starting to decay so leaving it for a day or so is not a problem. It is also a good idea to provide some leaf litter (decaying leaves - freezing is a good idea to reduce the number of bugs introduced on the leaves).  Calcium should be added to the diet - dust the food lightly with a vitamin supplement containing calcium.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	as a general rule, a 10-15 gallon aquarium is ample room for a couple of millipedes. Make sure the length of the tank is at least twice the length of the millipede (and the width as wide as the millipede is long). Floor space is more important than height. A lid is a good idea.	The humidity level should also be kept quite high, and this can be achieved by keeping the substrate damp (not wet) with regular misting.
Golden Geckos	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Golden geckos should be fed a variety of insect prey items. Crickets can make up the main part of the diet, with the addition of waxworms, mealworms, butterworms, roaches, and other insect prey. Prey should be gut loaded prior to feeding, and dusted with a calcium supplement two to three times a week and a multivitamin once a week. Feed in the evening; juveniles should be fed daily but adults do not need to be fed every day. Some keepers recommend varying the feeding schedule to keep them interested in their prey (e.g. feed every other day, then feed two days then skip a day, and so on). Feed as much prey at one time as the gecko eagerly eats.  Golden geckos will often take fruit as well: try bananas (mashed slightly), pureed baby food, and sliced fruit (especially tropical fruits such as mangos).  Notes: Golden geckos are skittish and have delicate skin, so are not good candidates for handling. They also have a bit of a reputation for biting when stressed.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Hamsters	Hamsters are popular pets, and for good reason. They are easy to care, usually bond well with their owners, and on top of everything else, they are very cute! Learn about choosing a pet hamster, pet hamster care, and providing all the necessities for your hamster in this handy hamster care guide.| Hamsters make good pets, but they are not the right choice for everyone. Learn about the pros and cons of hamster as pets before deciding if a hamster will be the right pet for you. You will also need to consider whether you want a larger Syrian hamster (always keep one to a cage), smaller dwarf hamsters (can be kept together), or even the less common but still lovely Chinese hamster. For more about choosing a pet hamster see Syrian Hamsters (http://exoticpets.about.com/od/hamsters/p/syrianhams.htm), golden hamsters, teddy bear hamsters (long hair), black bear hamsters, (black coat)Dwarf hamsters (http://exoticpets.about.com/od/hamsters/p/dwarfhams.htm) - includes dwarf Campbells Russian hamster, dwarf winter white Russian hamsters, and Roborovski hamstersChinese Hamsters (http://exoticpets.about.com/od/hamsters/p/chinesehams.htm).| Avoid taking home a hamster that shows common signs and symptoms of illness, stress, or other problems. While some problems can be hidden, anybody can do a quick check for some common signs of illness or other problems. While there are no guarantees, avoiding hamsters with obvious signs of problems gives you have the best chance of taking home a healthy hamster. Since many diseases are contagious, it is safest to also avoid hamsters with cage mates that seem ill.  As an added bonus, you can also get clues about a hamster\'s temperament while doing a quick health check.	\N	\N	\N	\N	There are also a lot of choices when it comes to hamster food, and not all are created equal. You main choice will be between a pelleted diet and a loose mix (see based) diet, and each has pros and cons. Your store-bought hamster diet can also be supplemented with a variety of healthy human foods and treat.	Hamsters need to be able to chew, and they need to be able to exercise.  Hamsters really were made to run, so a running wheel is a must. A hamster wheel must be large enough (many hamster wheels are more appropriate for dwarf hamsters than Syrian hamsters), safe (no wire wheels, please), and for your sanity, quiet. For chewing, a variety of wood structures and toys will help keep your hamster\'s teeth in shape. Hamsters also tend to like play tubes and tunnels and things they can climb on. For more about hamster toys and wheels see Hamster Wheels and Balls (http://exoticpets.about.com/od/hamsters/a/hamsterwheels.htm).  Homemade Tubes for Hamsters Made from File Folders (http://exoticpets.about.com/od/hamsters/ss/filetubes.htm).	\N	Hamsters that haven\'t been handled may not be happy about being picked up and may try to bite you. It\'s important to remember hamsters that bite are not mean -- they are scared and defending themselves the best way they know how.  It may take some patience (and possible some treats) to win your hamster\'s trust. More about handling hamsters. Help! My Hamster Bites - What Can I Do?  (http://exoticpets.about.com/od/hamsters/f/hamsterbiting.htm)	\N	\N	Having a cage all set up and waiting for your hamster is a good way to smooth your hamsters\' transition to his or her new home. There are a huge variety of cage styles and sized out there, and which one to choose can be confusing. My best advice is don\'t be fooled by the \"coolness\" of the cage, and make sure you choose one that is appropriate for the size of hamster you are choosing as well as one that is easy to clean. Also make sure you have cage accessories such as bedding, an exercise wheel, and a cozy sleep hut picked out.  Here\'s some tips about choosing supplies.

House Gecko	Common house geckos reach an adult length of 3-5 inches (total length). Their color varies the from a yellowish tan color with darker spots or blotches in the light to a pale greyish-white; they often appear more pale at night. They have specialized toe pads that allow them to effortlessly move along vertical surfaces and upside down.	House geckos need room to climb, so provide branches, driftwood, and silk or live plants.  They also need hiding spots such as reptile caves or small clay plant pots placed on their sides.  Provide enough hides to give multiple geckos space to hide from each other. A small shallow water dish can be provided, with fresh water daily, but they may prefer to drink from water droplets on leaves.	\N	\N	\N	House geckos should be fed a variety of smallish prey items. Crickets can make up the main part of the diet, with the addition of fruit flies and other small flies, silkworms, the occasional mealworm, and other insect prey.  Prey should be gut loaded (/cs/reptilesgeneral/g/gutloading.htm) prior to feeding, and dusted with a calcium supplement two to three times a week and a multivitamin once a week. Feed in the evening; juveniles should be fed daily but adults can be fed every other day (feed as much prey as your house gecko will consume eagerly).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	A 20 gallon tall terrarium is sufficient for a couple of house geckos, but bigger is better.  Keep in mind that house geckos need vertical space for climbing so use a tall tank. Males are territorial so should only be kept one to a cage, but females get along.	House geckos need a moderate to high humidity level; aim for 60-75 percent relative humidity (use a hygrometer to measure).  Provide humidity with regular misting; the geckos will likely drink from water droplets left from the mist.
Jackson\'s Chameleon	\N	Provide lots of sturdy non-toxic plants and branches. Ficus trees have often been used in chameleon housing, but require some caution as the sap can be irritating. Other plants you could try include pothos, hibiscus, and dracaena. Artificial plants may also be added, and artificial vines are a great addition. A good selection of branches (of different diameters) should be provided, making sure there are secure perches at different levels and temperatures within the cage.	Young chameleons are brownish in color, developing brighter green coloration at about 4-5 months of age. Males tend to be more brightly colored, with blue or yellow markings. Stressed or cold chameleons are typically a dark brown color. Males of all the subspecies have 3 horns that make them look like mini-triceratops (2 subocular horns below the eyes and one rostral horn on the snout). Females of some sub-species do have horns, but sometimes less developed than those of the males.	\N	\N	Chameleons are insectivores so should be fed a variety of insects.  Crickets are usually the mainstay of the diet, but mealworms, superworms and waxworms (all in limited quantities), roaches, silkworms, flies, fruit flies (young chameleons), and grasshoppers can also be fed. Wild-caught insects should only be fed if you are certain they have not been exposed to pesticides, and avoid fireflies. All insects should be gut loaded (feed fresh foods and vitamin/minerals) before feeding. In addition, some chameleons will also eat a bit of plant matter (including live plants in the cage, so use non toxic plants). Collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, and sugar snap pea pods can be tried (these can be clipped to the side of the cage). You will have to monitor your chameleon and adjust feeding amounts as needed (if many insects are left uneaten or your chameleon is too full-bodied, back off the amount fed).  Don\'t leave uneated live prey in the cage for extended periods as the insects may attack and injure your chameleon.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Chameleons should never be kept in a glass terrarium - they need the ventilation provided by a mesh enclosure (fine metal or fiberglass mesh is not recommended; PVC coated hardware cloth is good). Vertical space is essential and a minimum size of 24 inches by 24 inches by 36 inches tall is recommended (the taller the better - chameleons like to climb high up off the ground.). An outdoor cage can be used when the weather is warm enough, as long as overheating is prevented.	Jackson\'s chameleons need a humidity level of 50-80 percent. This can be accomplished by misting the plants regularly (at least twice daily), and the use of a drip or misting system is also recommended.  Chameleons rarely drink from a water bowl, but they will lap up droplets of water off plants, so the misting and a drip system also serves as a water source. Position a drip system so the water droplets cascade over the plants in the enclosure. Invest in a hygrometer  to measure humidity.
King Snakes	King snakes and milk snakes are beautiful, quite docile snakes.Milk and king snakes are closely related, both belonging to the genus Lamproletis,and there are several subspecies of both king snakes and milk snakes.Colors and patterns vary between the subspecies, but there are many striking and beautiful patterns to be found among these snakes.  Some subspecies utilize a natural defense of mimicking the appearance of the venomous coral snakes, with bands of red, black and yellow. (Coral snakes have yellow bands touching the red bands, while the king and milk snakes have black touching the red bands.) Milk and king snakes can be found from southern parts of Canada, throughout the US, and in Central and parts of South America.  They are constrictors, suffocating their prey before eating. In the wild they will eat other snakes, lizards, amphibians,rodents and birds. Snakes are a common food item, and they have the ability to eat larger snakes with some eating even rattlesnakes as a staple in their diet. Both king and milk snakes will try to eat cage mates,so should be housed on their own.  The basic care for king snakes and milk snakes however, is the same for most species and subspecies. For breeding these snakes, more attention needs to be paid to duplicating the conditions (including hibernating)that the snakes would find in their natural habitat.| Milk and king snakes breed quite readily in captivity, so it should be relatively easy to find a captive bred specimen.  Things to look for in a healthy snake (any kind of snake):firm rounded body, clear eyes (may be a little cloudy if about to shed), no discharge, or signs of mites (check especially around head/eyes, look for dusty specks on body, (check hands after handling snake) no open mouth, breathing or gasping for breath, inside of mouth uniformly pink (reddened areas or cheesy looking matter may indicate mouth rot) shiny smooth skin with no scabs or sores, clean vent with no swelling in area, should move smoothly with no tremors. A new snake may not be all that tame, but should settle down fairly well with gentle handling. A snake that is distressed will wave its body in the air trying to escape. Most king and milk snakes will settle down after a bit and wrap itself gently around your hands.  It is also wise to make sure that the snake is readily feeding on pre-killed mice.  If you have doubts, ask for a demonstration of the snake feeding.  New snakes should have a fecal check for parasites done, and treated as necessary. A check up with a veterinarian is a good idea as well.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Kinkajous	Kinkajous are nocturnal tree-dwellers (in the wild they spend most of their time in the treed canopy of rainforests). They have prehensile tails which help with climbing, and although they kind of resemble monkeys they are actually members of the same family as raccoons, coatimundis, and red pandas (among others). Their wild populations are declining due to habitat destruction, hunting, and the illegal pet trade. In the wild, it appears they primarily eat fruit and nectar.  If hand raised from an young age, they can be quite tame, but remember they are wild animals. They are active and curious, and they like to get into things.  They are nocturnal and are most active in the late evening.  While they do not have much of an odor, they can be messy, partly from tossing food around and partly because litter/house training isn\'t really feasible (they do tend to pick a few favorite toilet areas). They can also be territorial, especially when it comes to food.  Kinkajous can be quite noisy at times, especially when defending their food source. However, they have a variety of vocalizations that include a soft huffing, chirping or whistling, a \"barking\" noise (like a yelping dog), and a shrill shriek that can be very loud (a feeding call).	Providing a number of sturdy branches, thick cotton ropes, and ledges allows lots of exercise. In addition you can try a variety of toys in the cage too, such as hanging wood/rope parrot toys and wide pieces of PVC pipe.  Hammocks or sleep sacks can also be hung in the cage. An opaque plastic storage container with a hole cut in the side and suspended from the walls of the cage can be used as a nest box. A wooden box can also be used, but may be difficult to clean if soiled.  Heavy ceramic food bowls or a bowl that can be securely attached to the side of the cage might are good for feeding. Kinkajous can be messy at feeding time and anything that keeps them from dumping their food is ideal. Water can be provided in a bowl but these are prone to being dumped or dirtied, so a heavy water bottle with a sipper tube might work better (make sure your kinkajou figures out how to drink from the sipper tube before completely making a switch though).	\N	\N	\N	Kinkajous primarily feed on fruits and nectar in the wild, although if the opportunity arises, they will sometimes eat insects, eggs, and frogs along with other plants and blossoms. In captivity, they can be fed monkey biscuits or chow, and a variety of fruits (especially tropical fruits) such as bananas, papayas, mangoes, melons, kiwis, grapes, pineapple, pomegranates, cherimoya, figs, etc. It is said that some are allergic to strawberries so these are best avoided, and experts recommend avoiding citrus fruits such as oranges and grapefruit, and avocadoes. Dairy products should also be avoided. Chocolate and caffeine should never be given (to any pet).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Kinkajous need a large tall cage (e.g. 4 feet wide, by 6-8 feet long, and 6 feet tall--the larger the better). Provide lots of branches, ledges/shelves, and ropes for climbing. Kinkajous need lots of play and exercise time outside of their cage daily as well, for socialization and preventing boredom. Most owners find it best to confine kinkajous at night (when kinkajous are most active and their owners are trying to sleep) and when they are not supervised.	\N
Leopard Gecko	\N	\N	Leopard geckos are commonly yellow and white with black spots (hatchlings start out more striped, and gradually change to the spotted appearance). There are several color and pattern (e.g. jungle (http://www.bright.net/~a1rep/a1leocare.html)) variations.	\N	\N	Leopard geckos are insectivores: feed a variety of crickets, waxworms, meal worms (in moderation only) and even an occasional pinkie mice for adults.  Insects must be gut loaded for at least 24 hours prior to feeding, and coated with a calcium/D3 supplement (every feeding for young lizards, every other feeding for adults). Feed juveniles daily (a few crickets), adults can be fed every other day (6-10 crickets).	\N	Leopard geckos are nocturnal, ground dwelling geckos that are generally docile and easy to tame. They do not have the toe pads like other geckos so do not climb as well. They do have eyelids, also unlike other geckos.	\N	\N	\N	A 15-20 gallon tank is large enough for 2-3 leopard geckos, but there should only be one male per tank (and only keep males and females together if prepared to deal with offspring!). Half logs provide hiding and climbing space, as can commercial reptile caves and simple cardboard boxes. A damp hide box can help with shedding (a plastic container with a hole in the lid, with moist soil or moss inside).	\N
Mexican Redknee Tarantulas	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Crickets and other large insects (absolutely must be pesticide free), occasional pinky mouse.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	A small (5-10 gallon) tank is suitable for Mexican redknee tarantulas.  The width of the tank should be two to three times wider than the leg span of the spider wide, and only as tall as the spider\'s leg span. 2-3 inches of peat moss, soil, or vermiculite can be used as a substrate. Wood, cork bark, or half of a small clay flower pot can be used for a shelter/retreat.	60-75\\%
Mice	The most commonly available type of mouse available as a pet is the domestic pet mouse. These pet mice have been selectively bred to enhance the desirable qualities of the mice. There are also spiny mice (which are desert creatures that are a bit trickier to care for), but for the purposes of this article we will discuss the ordinary domestic mouse.  Ordinary does not mean boring, however.If you have ever seen a group of pet mice playing, you realize they can be quite entertaining pets. They are a bit skittish and harder to handle than some of the lager rodents such as rats, but they can become quite tame and will take food from the hand and allow themselves to be handled if started at a young age. Mice are quite ideal as small pets that are entertaining to watch, are easy to care for and make very few demands on their owners.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mice are nocturnal and very social. They will be very active in the evening and night, but don\'t expect to do much with them during the day. Being social, they are best kept in groups.A pair of females is the easiest, although larger groups are fine if you provide the cage space. Pairs of males should be avoided, unless they are litter mates, never separated, and given a large enough cage that they can have their own space (unfamiliar males are very likely to fight).Keeping males and females together should be avoided unless you want lots of mice in a short amount of time.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Northern Leopard Frogs	\N	small pieces of wood provide hiding and climbing opportunities (leopard frogs are not great climbers). Plants (live or silk) provide additional hiding spots (and therefore security), although frogs can damage live plants.  Water the water used must be dechlorinated. Use a product from the pet store designed to remove chorine (and chloramine, if your water supply is treated with chloramine) to be safe. Filtration is not a necessity, but doing a 50\\% water change on a regular basis (at least twice weekly, perhaps more) is necessary.  (In fact, some experts believe that the constant water vibrations from the filter is a sensory overload to frogs).  Lid a secure lid (preferably a mesh lid with lots of ventilation) is also a must - most frogs are adept at escaping, given the chance.	\N	\N	\N	Leopard frogs should be fed a variety of invertebrates such as crickets, wax worms, fly larvae, and earthworms. A meal of 3-4 crickets daily is a good starting point, although some experts recommend feeding mature frogs only every other day. Variety seems to be key with frogs - crickets can make up the bulk of the diet but should be supplemented by a variety of other insects and worms. Prey items should be gut loaded (feed nutritious foods such as fruits, vegetables, dog food, fish food etc.) before being given to the frog. Once weekly dust the crickets with a complete reptile vitamin mix.  Keep an eye on the body shape of your frog. Remember that overfeeding is likely more of a problem than underfeeding so make sure the frog is not getting too round and cut back on feeding if necessary.	\N	\N	\N	These frogs are genetically programmed to hibernate, so will naturally slow down and may stop eating in the winter months (usually for about 3 months). If possible, the tank can be cooled to 37-39F (3-4C) for three months to mimic the natural environment of the frogs.	\N	Tank a ten gallon tank is sufficient for a single frog (if keeping more frogs the tank size must increase, keeping in mind that floor space is more important than height). Leopard frogs are semi aquatic and need a land area as well as a large enough body of water that they can submerge their bodies. A half land/half water tank is a good choice for leopard frogs and these can be set up a number of ways (see Frogland\'s Housing (http://allaboutfrogs.org/info/housing/halftank.html) section for ideas). It is easiest in the long term to separate the land and water areas with a piece of plastic or Plexiglas placed across the aquarium and sealed with aquarium grade silicone sealant. This allows the use of soil on the terrestrial side to allow the frogs to burrow. A dense piece of wood (e.g. driftwood) can be placed partly in the water and partly on land to provide an easy transition from water to land (this also provides a nice basking spot). Alternately, gravel can be sloped in the aquatic side to provide a ramp out of the water.	\N
Ornate Box Turtles	Ornate box turtles have a domed carapace that is brown with yellow lines on the scutes (sometimes described as a starburst pattern), with no central keel.  The plastron scutes have radiating yellow and brown lines. Their skin is dark grey (with white or yellow spots), and there is sometime green on the mature male\'s head.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Like other box turtles, ornate box turtles are carnivorous when young and omnivorous when adults, although they retain more carnivorous tendencies than other box turtles.   Calcium-dusted crickets, mealworms, waxworms and earthworms along with pinky mice should be fed. Grasses, dark leafy greens, and some vegetables and fruits can also be given.  Some turtles are nervous about eating in the open so feed in a sheltered area. More detail on feeding can be found here:  Feeding Box Turtles	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Ornate box turtles are not very hardy, and do best in an outdoor enclosure (often they do not thrive indoors).  They need a large enclosure with room to move around, with a high fence to keep them from climbing to escape.  Provide several hiding places such as logs or planks and provide a thick layer of loose peaty soil or  leaf litter to burrow into, and a shallow pan of water.  If kept indoors a large enclosure should be built.  See \"Outdoor Pens for Box Turtles\" for more information .	Though they come from generally dry areas, they create a humid micorenvironment for themselves by burrowing.  It is essential for this species to be able to burrow into a layer of loose soil (peat/soil mix combined with sphagnum can be used) or leaf litter (minimum 3-4 inches deep).  Regular misting or sprinkling of the enclosure is recommended along with having a pan of water always available.
Ornate Horned Frogs	This frog is relatively common in the pet trade, and gets its common (pet trade) name from the popular video game. The frog\'s generally rounded appearance and huge mouth led to the cute name. The frog\'s scientific name is Ceratophrys ornata, and it is also known as the ornate horned frog.  Pacman frogs are native to South America, and are terrestrial in nature. In fact, they are very poor swimmers and care must be taken that they do not drown in their water bowls.  These frogs are quite large, and can reach around 6-7 inches in length (15-17 cm), although males tend to be quite a bit smaller than females. They are generally about as wide as they are long, so are quite hefty for a frog. Their appetite matches their size, and they will pretty much eat anything that moves.  Pacman frogs have a reputation for being somewhat aggressive, which is largely undeserved. While they do sometimes bite, it is usually a case of the frog feeling threatened or simply confusing a finger with a food item.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Pacman frogs are pretty easy to feed in that they are not usually fussy eaters. Smaller frogs can be fed insects such as crickets or other common pet store prey insects such as mealworms, wax worms etc. These should be gut loaded prior to feeding (see \"Raising Crickets for Food\"). As they grow, they can be fed pinkie (newborn) mice, and larger mice can be fed as the frog grows.  Eventually they may take a medium sized mouse or pinkie rat. Guppies, a variety of insects, and even small frogs can also be fed. While small pacman frogs (eating insects) should be fed daily, larger frogs can be fed mice or feeder fish every 2-3 days. Adult frogs can probably be fed less frequently - the best guide is to feed based on your frog\'s body condition (if your frog is getting too round and fat, cut back how often it is fed).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Pacman frogs, despite their large size, are not very active and do not need a large cage. A 10 gallon tank is fine for one of these frogs. Because they will often try to eat cage mates, they should be kept singly. A cage top is recommended -- although they are not a huge risk for escapes, a cage top will help maintain temperature and humidity.  In the wild they spend much of their time in damp leaf litter. In captivity, the cage can be lined with paper or smooth rocks, as long as leaf litter or moss and some plants (live or artificial) are provided that the frog can burrow/hide in. They come from a humid environment so the substrate should be misted daily to help maintain humidity. In addition a shallow bowl of water should be provided. The dish must be fairly shallow (e.g. a ceramic saucer from a plant pot) to minimize the risk of the frog drowning.  Depending on how humid your tank is, the frog might spend much of its time in its water dish, so providing plants around the dish will help your frog feel secure. The water dish should also be in a warmer part of the cage.	\N
Panther Chameleons	\N	\N	Panther chameleons exhibit many different brilliant color morphs or phases named after the geographic location they come from in their native habitat of Madagascar. A good selection of photos of different color morphs of panther chameleons can be found on the AdCham site here (http://www.adcham.com/html/taxonomy/pardalismorphs.html). Females show less variation in color (often orange or brownish) and have a less dramatic \"helmet\" than males (comprised of ridges along the sides of the head), as well as being smaller.	\N	\N	Panther chameleons are insectivores so should be fed a variety of insects. Crickets are usually the mainstay of the diet, but locusts, roaches, butterworms (good for calcium), silkworms, flies, and grasshoppers can be fed, as well asmealworms, superworms and waxworms (in limited quantities as high in fat). Be wary of wild-caught insects due to possible exposure to pesticides, and avoid fireflies. All insects should be gut loaded (fed fresh veggies and vitamin/minerals) before feeding. In addition, some chameleons will also eat a bit of plant matter (including live plants in the cage, so it is vital that only non toxic plants are used). Collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, and sugar snap pea pods can be tried (these can be clipped to the side of the cage).  Monitor your chameleon and adjust feeding amounts as needed (if many insects are left uneaten or your chameleon seems to be getting chubby, back off the amount fed). Never leave live prey in the cage for extended periods as insects may attack the chameleon.	Provide lots of sturdy non-toxic plants and branches. Ficus trees have often been used in chameleon housing, but require some caution as the sap can be irritating. Other plants you could try include pothos, hibiscus, and dracaena. Artificial plants may also be added, and artificial vines are a great addition. A good selection of branches (of different diameters) should be provided, making sure there are secure perches at different levels and temperatures within the cage.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Chameleons should never be kept in a glass terrarium - they need the ventilation provided by a mesh enclosure (fine metal or fiberglass mesh is not recommended; PVC coated hardware cloth is good). Vertical space is essential and a cage size of 36 inches by 24 inches by 36-48 inches tall is recommended (the bigger and taller the better - chameleons like to climb high up off the ground).  An outdoor cage can be used when the weather is warm enough, as long as over heating is prevented.	Panther chameleons need a high humidity level (aim for 60-85 percent). This can be accomplished by misting the plants regularly, and a drip or misting system is also recommended. Chameleons rarely drink from a water bowl, but they will lap up droplets of water off plants, so the misting/drip system also serves as a water source. Position a drip system so the water droplets cascade over the plants in the enclosure. Invest in a hygrometer  to measure humidity.
Praying Mantis	Mantids come in a huge range of sizes, shapes and colors.  Some look like twigs (and use this as camouflage), some resemble crumpled dead leaves, and others have brightly colored and delicate features that make them look like blossoms. They also come from a variety of climates (mostly tropical).  However, all mantids are carnivores, feeding mainly on other insects and spiders (some of the larger mantids may even eat small amphibians and reptiles).	\N	\N	\N	\N	A variety of feeder insects should be provided for your praying mantis.  The best way to make sure nutritional needs are met is to feed a number of different kinds of prey (fruit flies and aphids for nymphs, instars and smaller mantids, and a variety of flying insects such as moths, fruit flies, and house flies along with an occasional cricket or mealworm for larger ones).  Make sure the prey has been gut loaded (feed a vitamin enriched food to the prey, which will be passed on to the mantis).	Several twigs should be provided and should reach almost to the top of the tank as the mantid will need space to hang from  a twig for molting.  Live potted plants or artificial plants can be used too, but make sure not to overcrowd the tank.  Your praying mantis will need space to move about, hunt, and molt.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mantids should be housed individually. However, a praying mantis needs only a small tank -- generally a tank should be at least twice as wide and three times as tall as the mantid, but not much larger than that.  If the tank is too large, the mantid will have a hard time finding its prey.  A tank about 12 inches by 12 inches, by 12 inches tall is a good size for most praying mantises.  The height of the tank is important to provide space for molting.  A mesh top is preferred, and mesh openings on th side are good if possible.	The required humidity also varies by praying mantis species (e.g. the African mantis requires 60\\% humidity). Regular light misting of the tank will help provide humidity. A small, shallow water dish containing pebbles or a piece of sea sponge to prevent drowning can also be provided and will provide a humidity boost.  Be careful the humidity does not get too high.
Red Eared Sliders	Red eared sliders are semi aquatic turtles that are very commonly kept as pets. Unfortunately, lack of understanding what they require means that many red eared sliders have died from improper care. While they are not overly demanding as pets, many unsuspecting owners have been told that it was fine to keep them in small plastic bowls. Needless to say this housing is completely inadequate and impractical - turtle owners need to invest a fair amount in the proper equipment to house red eared sliders. With proper care these turtles can live several decades, so turtle ownership is not a commitment to be taken lightly.  Males tend to be smaller than females, but have large claws on the front legs and longer tails than females.  In the US, sale of red eared sliders under 4 inches in length have been banned since the 1970s. The ban was a result of the prevalence of Salmonella infections linked to pet turtles. Baby turtles were very popular as pets for small children, mostly because a lot of people did not realize the cute tiny turtles sold in pet stores could carry Salmonella or that they could grow so large.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Red eared sliders are omnivores, meaning they eat a mixture of animal and plant material. Younger turtles are more carnivorous (eat more animal protein) than adults, though. Juveniles should be fed daily, but adults can be fed every 2-3 days.  Turtles can be fed a mixture of prepared commercial food and fresh food. Special food formulated for turtles can be used, but this should only make up about 25\\% of the total diet. The proportions of fresh supplements will depend on the age of the turtle, but can include live feeder fish, earthworms, crickets, waxworms, bloodworms, aquatic snails, fresh greens (collard, mustard and dandelion greens, and dark leafy lettuces but never head lettuce), aquatic plants, and shredded vegetables. For more detail, see \"What Should I Feed my Red Eared Slider?\"	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
Red Footed Tortoises	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	In the wild, red footed tortoises are omnivores and eat a wider range of foods than many other tortoises. It is important to not overfeed animal protein, though; one very small serving of moistened low fat cat food or lean meat (e.g. 1 ounce for a full grown red foot) every 1-2 weeks is enough. A variety of fresh leafy greens (dandelion greens, endive, mustard greens, escarole; not lettuce, spinach or kale), vegetables, and fruits should also be fed (they also tolerate fruit better than many other species). A calcium and vitamin D3 supplement should be used.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Outdoors, this species is tropical and prefers a humid climate. A sturdy escape-proof enclosure can be provided, and a sprinkler or mister can be used to increase the humidity if needed. A muddy wallow will be used by this tortoise, as will a pan of water. An area densely planted with vegetation provides a cool retreat. A doghouse-type shelter can be used, and should be heated if nightime temperatures drop below 65-70 F (18-21 C). Daytime temperatures can be up to 90-95 F (32-35 C).  Indoors a large enclosure is needed - 4 feet by 6 feet or larger.  Cypress bark as a substrate helps retain humidity, although paper will work and is easy to clean. A UVA/UVB is necessary indoors, and the enclosure should be heated, with a basking spot of 95 F (35 C) and a gradient from about 80-90 F (27-32 C).  Nightime temperatures can drop to about 75 F (24 C). A pan of water should be provided and the enclosure should be kept humid. A hide should be placeed at the cool end of the enclosure.	\N
Savannah Monitors	Quite readily available in the pet trade.Life span of 10-12 years.At 3 to 4 feet fully grown, the Savannah is a medium sized monitor but still requires a very large enclosure.With regular handling and attention, Savannah monitors can become fairly tame, unlike some other monitors. All monitors can inflict deep painful bites and scratches. Despitetheir availability, Savannah monitors are not a good choice for beginning reptile keepers, due to their size and habitat requirements.Monitors are considered to be among the most intelligent reptiles.  They are also escape artists and require a very secure enclosure.It is best to obtain a captive bred juvenile if possible.	\N	\N	Need a very large and secure enclosure. Juveniles can start out in a large tank (e.g. 55 gallon) but will grow quickly so new owners might want to start with an adult sized custom enclosure. The adult enclosure should be at least twice as long as the monitor and as wide as the the monitor\'s length, so a minimum of 8 feet by 4 feet wide should be planned. It should be as tall as is practical (reduces the chances of climbing out). Solid sides are recommended to allow maintenance of high temperatures, and no screens (will be quickly shredded). The enclosure must be solidly constructed, or Savannahs will find a way to break out! Alternatively, some owners dedicate a room (suitably monitor-proofed) to their Savannah monitor.	\N	Monitors are generally good eaters, and will become obese if over fed, often leading to health problems.Juveniles can be fed a combination of insects (a variety is best, such as crickets, earthworms and Zoophorba worms) and mice.  Start with pinkies when the monitor is large enough, and work up in size as the monitor grows.Insects can be fed live (and provide exercise as the monitor hunts) but it is recommended that rodents be fed pre-killed. Use tongs to offer pre-killed prey.Adults can eat mice and small rats. Avoid feeding prey too large (no wider than the monitor\'s head) or regurgitation of the meal may occur.Juveniles can be fed every 2-3 days (1-4 pinkie or fuzzy mice, along with insects as long as they will accept them), and adults twice a week. The amount the adults need is a matter of judgement based on body condition and activity (remembering that obesity is common in monitors).Low fat, high quality dog food or canned monitor food can be fed occasionally only.	\N	\N	\N	\N	a couple of hides should be provided, at each end of the temperature gradient. Cardboard boxes can be used for the rapidly growing juveniles (start small and replace with larger boxes as needed), and wooden boxes are a good choice for adults. A few large rocks or other furnishings can be provided, but monitors are fairly destructive so don\'t go overboard.	\N	\N
Scorpion	Scorpions are becoming increasingly popular as pets, especially emperor scorpions. They are not great for handling,but they are quiet, clean and easy to care for.  Emperor scorpions are not particularly dangerous, in contrast to some other species of scorpion. Their sting has been likened to a bee sting in that it is painful, but medical attention is not usually necessary.However, some people may have an anaphylactic reaction to the venom (as some people do with bee stings) so it is wise to not take chances.Some people say that emperor scorpions are more likely to pinch you with their pedipalps, and this can be quite painful too. In any case, handling of pet scorpions isn\'t recommended, in part because of the risks,but also because scorpions are likely to be stressed if handled.Most people recommend that if handling is necessary (e.g. when cleaning cages) a pair of long handled forceps with foam over the grips be used to pick up the scorpion by the stinging end.  Emperors are large scorpions, at around 6 inches long.They are black (with green or brown hues) and have an impressive set of pedipalps (\"claws\"). As far as scorpions go,they are quite docile, but as mentioned above handling isn\'t recommended.	\N	\N	\N	\N	In the wild, scorpions eat a variety of invertebrates (insects, other arthropods) and vertebrates including small lizards. In captivity,they seem to do fine with a diet primarily of crickets, supplemented with other insects such as meal worms and moths. An adult emperor will only need 3 -6 adult crickets per week (feed every other day or so).The crickets should be fed a nutritious diet so that the nutritional value is passed on the the scorpions, and the crickets can be dusted with a quality reptile vitamin/mineral supplement every few feedings. Feed at night to replicate the conditions under which scorpions would naturally feed.  A shallow (shallow enough to prevent drowning) water dish should also be provided.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Providing the appropriate environment is the most challenging part of keeping scorpions. The proper heat and humidity is vital in preventing problems.  Emperors can be kept alone or in groups. If keeping more than one, a larger tank will be necessary, and a good rule of thumb is to have at least a couple more hiding spots than you have scorpions so they can each have their \"space.\" If there is any sign of aggression between the scorpions, however, I\'d recommend separating them.  Emperors are native to Africa and live in humid warm environment, and all scorpions are nocturnal. These factors are taken into account when creating a scorpion habitat.  Glass aquarium tanks are probably the easiest housing to use, and they should have a tight fitting secure lid. A 10 gallon tank is sufficient for one scorpion, but a larger one (20 -30 gallon) will be necessary for groups. However, don\'t give them too much space since it will be difficult for them to catch their prey in a large tank.  There are multiple opinions on the ideal substrate for emperor scorpions- some use soil, some use peat and others use vermiculite. No matter what you choose, it should be fairly deep (3 - 6 inches) to allow the scorpion(s)to dig burrows. Pieces of bark, flat stones, broken ceramic flowerpots or even commercial reptile hides should be provided as hiding spots for the scorpions. Providing pieces of sphagnum moss on top of the substrate will also aid in retaining moisture in the environment.Scorpions will move the cage decorations/furnishings around a bit, and although it may not look neat and tidy, it is best to avoid constantly rearranging the furnishings or else the scorpion(s) will become stressed.  The habitat should be maintained at a high humidity level by regular(daily) misting.  The substrate should be kept damp, but not wet.If there is mold on the substrate or condensation on the walls of the tank,the humidity is too high.	\N
Short Tailed Opossums	Short tailed opossums are growing in popularity as an exotic pet.They are small, generally friendly creatures which have good pet potential. They are certainly cute enough!  Short tailed opossums are from South America, and are 4-6 inches long (body only; their tail is almost as long as the body) with thick grey-brown fur. The tail is prehensile, meaning it can wrap around and hold onto things, and hairless. They are marsupials,although they do not have a pouch like most marsupials. However,their young are born quite premature and helpless, latch on to a nipple on their mother\'s abdomen, and stay there until they are further developed,like other marsupials. In the wild they will eat insects, spiders,and rodents. For this reason they are actually welcome house guests in their native countries. They are easily handled if tame from a young age, but should be kept as solitary pets because of their tendency to fight with other opossums. They are nocturnal so will be most active at night, although if they do awake they will be social during the day.	\N	\N	\N	\N	this is still a new area for short tails and owners and breeders tend to feed a wide variety of things. It is possible now to get commercially manufactured short tail food. Otherwise, a commercial insectivore diet probably provides the best basic diet, although some feed cat food, ferret food and a variety of other pelleted diets with success. Look for diets that are high in protein and low in fat.A variety of treats should be offered, including meal worms, crickets, fresh fruit and vegetables (offer a variety), and hard boiled egg. Feeding is best done at night, with items such as egg or chicken that will spoil removed after a short time. Occasional treats can include small amounts of cooked chicken and low fat yogurt. Using a general vitamin/mineral supplement is probably a good idea as well. Water is very important to short tails and they can dehydrate very quickly, so it is vitally important to make sure their water bottle is always accessible and filled with freshwater.	\N	\N	as mentioned above, short tailed opossums are best kept as solitary animals. A tame, often-handled young opossum will make the best pet (PawPrint Online recommends age 3-4 months to acquire a pet - when younger they can be quite nervous and hard to handle). Males and females have equal pet potential.They do tend to be very friendly and inquisitive when tame and will bean enjoyable and entertaining pet.  As with any other pet, the proper expectations, education and commitment is required to give a short tailed opossum a home. For further reading, an excellent site is Know Your STO - Short-Tailed Opossums (http://www.knowyoursto.com/) - by Molly Joy.	\N	\N	short tailed opossums are adept as escaping, so whatever enclosure is provided should be thoroughly escape proof. An aquarium(15-20 gallon) with a tight fitting lid, or a narrow-mesh wire cage should work well. The ambient temperature should be kept at 70 - 80 F.Bedding should be provided - corn cob litter or shavings (not cedar!) will work well. A nest box is also required (commercial woven nest, or a margarine tub etc.), and tissue or shredded paper (not newspaper) will be appreciated as nesting material. Branches for perching and climbing are needed - make sure they are non toxic and not treated with pesticides(parrot climbing toys and ladders also work well). In addition, a hamster wheel can be used to provide opportunity for exercise. Short tailed opossums are fairly tidy creatures and will usually pick a corner area area to use as a potty, so a litter pan can be placed here to make cage cleaning easier.	\N
Sugar Gliders	Sugar gliders have become a popular exotic pet. They are small and relatively easy to care for, and have a cute if not unusual appearance.As with any other exotic pet, a potential owner should be aware oftheir care requirements and personality before acquiring a sugar glider. Sugar glidersare illegal in some places so you will need to check the laws where your live (see \"How to Find Out if a Pet is Legal Where You Live\").  Sugar Gliders are marsupials; that is their young start life offin a pouch (like a kangaroo). They originally hail from Australia,Indonesia and New Guinea, and live in forests.  Their name is derivedfrom their diet (in part they feed on nectar and the sap of eucalyptus), and from the flap of skin they have betweentheir wrists and ankles that allows them to glide between trees.They are omnivorous, meaning they will eat plant material and meat - foodin the wild include nectar, fruit, insects and even smallbirds or rodents. They live in social family units in the wild, atrait which makes them inclined to bond well with their human family.However, if they are deprived of social interaction they will not thrive (in fact they can becomedepressed to the point where they may die).  Sugar gliders make endearing, playful, and entertaining pets. As mentioned above they are very social, and ideally they should be kept in pairs or groups, and in any case they should have a good deal of socialinteraction with their owners. They are fairly clean and do not have complex housing requirements.In addition, they tend to be fairly healthy (although it may be difficultto find an experienced vet to treat them) and can live to be 12-14 yearsin captivity. They do need a good amount of interaction (even ifit is just riding around in a pocket all day), and aren\'t great housetrainingcandidates. Their nails are sharp and will scratch if they need todig in while climbing or landing on you (keep them well trimmed).They also have sharp teeth and though not aggressive, will bite if theyfeel threatened or frightened. If not acquired tame and used to beinghandled, it may take a great deal of time and patience to get them to the point where they are cuddly.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Sugar Gliders do have fairly strict dietary requirements. Theideal diet for sugar glider is still a widely debated topic among keepers.For some recommended diets, see \"Feeding SugarGliders\" for more information on diets and the diet options that are recommended by others. A potential problem in sugar gliders is paralysis stemming from an imbalance of calcium to phosphorus in the diet (i.e. too low in calcium and/or high in phosphorus). This diesease (called nutritional osteodystrophy) can be prevented by proper diet and vitamin/mineral supplements.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	As for housing, a cage of 24 by 24 inches, by 36 inches high is a good minimum size for a pair. This is a minimum, though - bigger is better and for sugar gliders the height is more valuable than floor space. The cage wire should be no more than 1/2 inch wide, and horizontal cage bars allow climbing.The interior of the cage should provide lots of interest with toys, andexercise wheel, nest box and/or glider pouch. Branches, ropes and ladders provide lots of opportunity for climbing and exercise. For more details on cages and accessories for sugar gliders, see \"Housing Sugar Gliders.\"	\N
Three Toed Box Turtle	Usually has only three toes on the hind feet (although sometimes they have 4, like other box turtles). They have a high domed carapace (shell) that is usually an olive brown with some yellow markings.  On the plastron, there may be dark areas.  The skin is brown with some yellow spots, and the males may have red markings on their heads (and sometimes red, orange and black on the neck and forelegs).	\N	\N	\N	\N	Adult three toed box turtles are omnivores.  Approximately half of their diet should be made up of vegetables, fruit, and hay/grasses.  The remainder is made up of low fat protein sources; whole live foods are ideal (earthworms, slugs, snails, mealworms, crickets, grasshoppers, small fish, etc) but cooked lean meats and low fat dog food can be added as a supplement.  Hatchlings are more carnivorous. More on feeding box turtles can be found in \" Feeding Box Turtles .\"	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	While it is possible to keep three toed box turtles (especially hatchlings and juveniles) in a  large  indoor terrarium (aquariums are too small), they do much better in outdoor enclosures where the climate is agreeable.  They should have easy access to a shallow pan of water at all times.  As well, they should have access to hiding spots, and loose litter for burrowing. See \" Outdoor Pens for Box Turtles \" for more on outdoor housing.	\N
Tiger Salamanders	Tiger salamanders  are strikingly beautiful salamanders that are quite popular as pets. They can be quite long lived (some estimate as much as 25 years), large, and usually become quite tame although their sensitive skin means that they should not be handled.  Tiger Salamanders have quite a wide range across North America, and although still quite common they are protected in some areas, with their wild populations declining in some areas due to shrinking habitats.It may be illegal to take them from the wild where you live so I don\'t recommend going out and catching one. It is a dilemma because captive bred tiger salamanders are not widely available as breeding has proven difficult; try to find a reputable dealer and if possible, a captive bred salamander.  There are several subspecies of tiger salamanders in North America.The basic coloration of tiger salamanders is yellow blotches, spots or bars against a black background, although patterns and intensity of color vary between the subspecies. As well, some subspecies have a tendency to exhibit neoteny, breeding in the larval form and never undergoing metamorphosis into the adult terrestrial form. The larval tiger salamanders closely resemble the axolotl (a related salamander that typically reproduces only in the larval form), and are sometimes sold as \"water dogs.\" Another potential source is bait shops where the larvae are sold as bait.  These guys probably have not received optimal care though so may be stressed or diseased.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Tiger salamanders have a healthy appetite, and should not be overfed as they will become obese.  Larva will take aquatic invertebrates such as Daphnia and brine shrimp,insects, small fish, and worms.  The adults can be fed a selection of feeder insects such as crickets,earthworms, and wax worms, a selection of wild caught insects (be sure the area collected from is not sprayed with pesticides) and can be offered the occasional pinkie mouse. Due to their size and strength, they shouldn\'t be housed with smaller salamanders.	\N	\N	Due to the sensitivity and delicate nature of their skin, salamanders should not be handled unless absolutely necessary. The salts and oils present on our skin can harm them, so if handling is necessary (e.g.while cleaning the cage) you should wash your hands well with soap, rinse very well, gently scoop up and fully support the salamanders, and minimize actual handling.  Tiger salamanders typically overcome their natural shyness easily and become quite responsive - coming to the sides of the tank when you approach their cage in anticipation of a meal. They are beautiful and rewarding pets, and have few demands beyond a clean cage and varied diet.	\N	\N	The larval stage is entirely aquatic, so can be set up in an aquarium with 6 inches of water and some rocks they can hide in. They should be kept at 65-70 F (18-21 C). A good filter is required and aeration with an air stone is recommended. Particular attention must be paid to water quality, especial ammonia buildup and pH of the water.See the article Salamander Housing for more detail on housing.  Eventually (may take months to years) the larva will lose its gills and emerge from the water, taking on the adult form. As this occurs, the amount of water in the tank should be gradually reduced and a land area provided. Once metamorphosis is complete the salamander can be kept in a terrestrial tank set up.A substrate suitable for burrowing must be provided.  Many owners use potting soil (no vermiculite), peat, and bark chips, or sphagnum moss.Anything that can be kept moist and allow burrowing is fine, so gravel is not appropriate. However, keep in mind that due to their size and healthy appetites, tiger salamanders do produce quite a bit of waste,so their cages will need frequent cleaning. Do not expect to have a permanent or elaborate set up.  Plants, bark pieces, rocks or other hiding places should also be provided (multiple hiding spots per cage).Again temperatures of around 65-70 F (18-21 C) are acceptable, but the temperature should not be allowed to increase over 72 F (22 C).  A shallow dish of water should also be provided; large but shallow(no more than 1-2 inches deep). Your salamanders might enjoy soaking in the dish, and the water will need regular cleaning too.  Heating is typically not required as tiger salamanders should be kept at room temperature or slightly below. The enclosure should not be wet, but the substrate should be slightly damp. When cleaning the tank, use only very hot water and no detergents. Salamanders have extremely sensitive skin and also absorb chemicals readily through their skin.  UV lighting is not required, but a regular light-dark cycle mimicking that of the area they are native to should be maintained with incandescent lighting, preferably on a timer.	\N
Tokay Geckos	\N	\N	Tokay geckos are very distinctive, colorful geckos. Usually a blue-grey color with bright orange and blue spots.	\N	\N	Tokay geckos are usually voracious eaters and can be fed a variety of insect prey (crickets, superworms, mealworms, waxworms, grasshoppers, cockroaches, etc). Larger tokays may take pinky mice. Prey should be gut loaded prior to feeding, and dusted with a vitamin supplement containing calcium.  Juveniles can be fed daily; adults every other day or so.	\N	Tokay geckos are nocturnal, and have a bit of a reputation for biting (they are pretty fiesty and can deliver a painful bite, so care is warranted).  With regular interaction they usually become less aggressive but generally will not be good for handling. They can be quite vocal and that is where their name arises as their call sounds like \"To-kay! To-kay!\" Never house males together.	\N	\N	\N	\N	should be kept at about 70\\% (do not let it drop under 50\\%) by misting.  The proper substrate will help retain humidity.
Veiled Chameleons	\N	\N	The veiled chameleon has a large, tall casque, or helmet-like structure on the top of their head. It is present in both males and females, though it is larger in males. Their bodies are banded in shades of green, yellow and brown.	\N	\N	Veiled chameleons are mostly insectivores so should be fed a variety of insects, but will often consume vegetation as well. Crickets are usually the mainstay of the diet, but locusts, roaches, butterworms (good for calcium), silkworms, flies, and grasshoppers can be fed, as well as mealworms, superworms and waxworms (in limited quantities as high in fat). Be wary of wild-caught insects due to possible exposure to pesticides, and avoid fireflies. All insects should be gut loaded (fed fresh veggies and vitamin/minerals) before feeding. In addition, many veiled chameleons will also eat a bit of plant matter (including live plants in the cage, so it is vital that only non toxic plants are used).  You can offer small amounts of vegetables and fruits such as dandelion leaves, collard greens, kale, diced zucchini, butternut squash, red pepper, blueberries, thin slices of apple or pear, etc. Monitor your chameleon and adjust feeding amounts as needed (if many insects are left uneaten or your chameleon is too full-bodied, back off the amount fed). Never leave live prey in the cage for extended periods as insects may attack the chameleon.	Provide lots of sturdy non-toxic plants and branches. Ficus trees have often been used in chameleon housing, but require some caution as the sap can be irritating. Other plants you could try include pothos, hibiscus, and dracaena. Artificial plants may also be added, and artificial vines are a great addition. A good selection of branches (of different diameters) should be provided, making sure there are secure perches at different levels and temperatures within the cage.	\N	\N	\N	\N	Chameleons should never be kept in a glass terrarium - they need the ventilation provided by a mesh enclosure (fine metal or fiberglass mesh is not recommended; PVC coated hardware cloth is good). Vertical space is essential and a cage size of 36 inches by 24 inches by 36-48 inches tall is recommended (the bigger and taller the better - chameleons like to climb high up off the ground).  An outdoor cage can be used when the weather is warm enough, as long as over heating is prevented.	Veiled chameleons need a moderate humidity level (around 50 percent). Misting the plants twice daily will help with humidity levels, and a drip or misting system is also recommended. Chameleons rarely drink from a water bowl, but they will lap up droplets of water off plants, so the misting/drip system also serves as a water source. Position a drip system so the water droplets cascade over the plants in the enclosure. Invest in a hygrometer to measure humidity.
White lined Geckos	White lined geckos reach an adult length of around 9-10 inches (incluidng tail). Their bodies are brown, green or tan, and have a white stripe on each side of the heads that converges on the back and runs down to the tail base (the tail has broad white bands). They have specialized toe pads that allow them to effortlessly move along vertical surfaces.	White lined geckos need room to climb, so provide a mix of branches, driftwood, corkbark, bamboo, and vines at a variety of heights and orientations.  Add a variety of silk and/or sturdy live plants (e.g. dracena, snake plants) as they will hide in the plants for cover.  Provide caves, bark, or other items suitable for hides. A small shallow water dish can be provided, with fresh water daily, though they will likely prefer to drink water droplets from leaves.	\N	\N	\N	White lined geckos can be fed a diet mainly of crickets. A variety of other insects can be added for variety like roaches, locusts, cutworms and silkworms (waxworms and mealworms should be fed only occasionally).  Prey should be about the size of the space between the gecko\'s eyes, and should be  gut loaded  prior to feeding, and dusted with a calcium supplement two to three times a week and a multivitamin once a week.  Feed in the evening; juveniles should be feed daily but adults do not need to be fed every day (every other day, for example). Feed as much prey at one time as the gecko eagerly eats, and don\'t leave uneated crickets roaming aroung the tank.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	A 20 gallon tall terrarium is sufficient for a couple of white lined geckos (never house males togther), but bigger is better as white lined geckos are active lizards.  White lined geckos need vertical space for climbing so use a tall tank. Males are territorial so should only be kept one to a cage. A glass terrarium with a screened top or side for ventilation works well.	White lined geckos need a moderately high humidity level; aim for 65-75 percent relative humidity (get a hygrometer and monitor levels as humidity is very important).  Provide humidity with regular misting with warm filtered water; depending on your cage set up you may need to mist a few times a day, and make sure the cage is well-misted at night when their activity is highest. White lined geckos will likely drink from water droplets left from the mist.
White\'s Tree Frog	\N	\N	Their color ranges from a green to a blue green or aqua color, and can be quite striking. They have a waxy film or coating on their skin that helps them retain moisture, so these frogs can tolerate more arid conditions than some other tree frogs	\N	\N	A diet of primarily crickets can be fed to White\'s tree frogs. Other items that can be fed include moths, beetles, cockroaches,grasshoppers, and earthworms. Fully grown White\'s may even take pinkie mice on occasion. Insects can be simply placed in the cage, or offered using blunt (rounded) tip forceps.  The amount needed by your frog will very somewhat, but keep in mind that White\'s tree frogs tend toward obesity, so do not over feed.As a very general guideline, feed large frogs(greater than 3 inches long) a few larger crickets every 2-3 days, adjusting based on the behavior (i.e. acting hungry or not interested in food) and body condition of the frog (see below). Smaller frogs can be offered about 3 week-old crickets every 2-3 days, and juveniles should be fed daily. The best way to judge how much to feed is looking at the frog\'s body condition. Look for ridges just above the frog\'s eardrum - if there are no noticeable ridges the frog is likely underweight and should be fed more or more often.If the ridges become prominent and start to sag or fold over, then the frog is obese and should be eating less.  The insects fed to the frog should be gut loaded (fed a nutritious diet that is then passed on to the frog - for more information on cricket care,see \"Raising Crickets\"). In addition,the food should be dusted with a calcium/vitamin supplement (daily in very young frogs, once or twice a week for intermediate sized frogs, and once a week for mature frogs).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
